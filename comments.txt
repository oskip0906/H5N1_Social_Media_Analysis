The virus that causes the condition is called H5N1. The human version of it has hit the global population at around the same time.

There will be outages but areas that have integrated Nuvve style V2G chargers, there’s a lot across the globe, will flood the grids affected &amp; use the newsreels to convince the general populous that EV buses are the “one size fits all” solution. 

There will be climate segregation - sorry climate lockdowns. There will be tourism deserts by design; multiple cities across the globe will close off their borders to stave off tourism under the guise of minimizing mass littering &amp; carbon output reduction. 

There will be an increase in the H5N1 rates to the point where newsreels discuss the impact in relation to child rearing &amp; there will be a rise in malnutrition rates across the globe, more noticeable in western nations with mega poultry farms as they are being affected the most.

it will mostly come from animal abuse / consumption / agriculture like most other ones, avian flu (H5N1) swine flu (H1N1), covid, HIV.

Pretty easy to avoid, but humans are too stupid to do so.

We didn't have a pandemic in 1997. That influenza didn't spread across the entire globe.

Also I don't remember lockdowns. Just tons of dead birds and a lot of fear mongering/hysteria. Did I miss something? Or were you in a spot that a severe spread of H5N1?
2023-01-02 19:33:25

My prediction is it'll be H5N1 avian flu.
2023-01-03 10:06:49

There was an H5N1 avian flu outbreak that required killing off a number of birds in early December.

1. Se acerca un nuevo encierro por el Covid o por otra pandemia (Busca H5N1)
2. Estamos a punto de entrar en una nueva crisis económica mundial,  la burbuja esta a nada de reventar.

Así que yo diría que este año empieza el colapso de nuevo jajajaj
2023-01-03 13:15:25
------------------------------------
I don't think zombies or zombie analogues are a particularly realistic prep, however I *do* think pandemics are a valid threat (as proven by covid) and most zombie based fiction is really a metaphor for a pandemic so there are things that can be applicable.

Less so the whole "shoot em in the head" thing but moreso having the supplies necessary to bug in and withstand the initial outbreak and panic until things have settled down a bit.

A good example is March-April of 2020 when we didn't know what covid was yet and everything was locked down and we saw disruptions to the supply chain + a severe shortage things like toilet paper, cleaning solutions, masks, etc. We were lucky that covid turned out to have a low mortality rate but there's not much stopping a much worse virus like H5N1 or H7N9 from mutating and developing human-human transmission capability.

Now *that* would be apocalyptic. Think of what the bubonic plague did to medieval Europe, except now picture it happening on a global scale with 17 times the population density and a global airborne transport system to spread it. Avian flu strains have a 50-90% estimated mortality rate. The upper estimate is likely to be an overestimate because there is an element of selection bias - it goes without saying that only the severe cases will seek hospitalizations and be tallied, so there is of course going to be a portion of the population that doesn't experience severe symptoms and may just stay at home to recover. However even with that lower bound of a 50% mortality rate, even that would make covid pale in comparison.

Imagine how severe the world's reaction would have been in March 2020 if people were dropping dead left and right, with HALF the people who catch it dying. Mass panic and hysteria. Severe lockdowns and quarantines. Likely an enforced curfew, National Guard mobilization, states closing their borders, transportation restrictions, and I can't even imagine what would happen to the supply chain and the economy.

The issue is that after a certain inflection point is reached, shit hits critical mass and nothing functions properly anymore. For example with a virus with a 50% mortality rate, what would absenteeism in critical infrastructure look like? If the people who work at power plants, water treatment facilities, wastewater plants, law enforcement, local administrators, etc don't show up for work because they don't wanna die - what happens then?

Also IMO the scariest part of the covid outbreak for me was witnessing just how large a chunk of the population simply refused to believe it was real! Hopefully if there were ever a future outbreak of a virus with a 50% mortality rate people would take it more seriously, but I think it has been definitively proven that there WILL be a small subset of people who for whatever reason simply will not or cannot believe the threat is real, and these people will be out there catching the virus and spreading it to others much like a theoretical zombie would be doing. What's even scarier though is that this is not some clearly delineated threat like a zombie is. If you think about it, a super spreader is far more terrifying than a zombie. Imagine a zombie, except it doesn't have to bite you to infect you - it just has to be near you OR if you touch something it touched previously OR if you're even in a room that it was in before you, you will get infected. AND these "zombies" are technically intelligent (relatively speaking lol) and will walk around coughing their germs everywhere and touching shit like elevator buttons and groceries at the grocery store and door handles and railings on buses and trains. AND you can't even dispose of the threat like you could with a zombie. A zombie you can just shoot or contain or otherwise deal with. A living person? You can't do any of those things. A super spreading human zombie is far more of a threat than an actual fantasy zombie. 

Plus you know how in zombie movies there's always that one moron who hides that he/she's infected and then inevitably ends up turning and infecting someone else with them? Well IRL, that's like half your family members. And often times it's not even intentional, because viruses have incubation periods and can start being infectious before severe symptoms start to crop up. So a high mortality viral threat will *really* be scary because people will have to seriously consider the threat of someone leaving to go get groceries or do essential work or whatever and then come home and spread it to their family, and if it's a 50/50 chance of killing your loved ones, how many people are willing to take that chance?

Therefore for all of these reasons I talked about, if we ever do experience a pandemic with a disease that has a significant mortality rate, we can expect societal breakdown, supply chain collapse, massive economic recession, and more.
2023-01-04 10:43:15
------------------------------------
Oh for sure. Even 20% mortality rate is enough for a temporary collapse. I mean think about it, would YOU be comfortable rolling the dice knowing you have a 1 in 5 chance of dying if you catch the virus? That's worse odds than Russian Roulette and I wouldn't play that shit for a million dollars.

What's scary as well is that influenza strains like H1N1, H1N2, H5N1, H7N9, actually have higher mortality rates among children, adolescents, and people in their 20s. It's the opposite of covid. Basically the stronger your immune system the higher the risk of death, because the mechanism by which it kills you is that it causes something called a cytokine storm where your body essentially kills itself trying to fight the infection.
2023-01-04 12:00:40
------------------------------------
First off a virus is not a living being, thus it technically has no lifespan.

Secondly Avian Influenza (H5N1) persists in viral infectivity for weeks up to months depending on the surface.

Maybe you are the one being pessimistic about the amount of time it takes to produce and distribute a batch of jackets........

H5N1 crosses over into humans regularly. It just doesnt spread between them. We're really just one mutation away.

That said, H5N1 moves much faster than COVID, so we might be better equipped to handle it

Trebuie doar sa sapi un pic mai mult. Ceea ce numim noi gripa e din categoria Influenza tip A.  
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza\_A\_virus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus)  


&gt;All influenza A pandemics since \[the Spanish flu pandemic\], and indeed almost all cases of influenza A worldwide (excepting human infections from avian viruses such as H5N1 and H7N7), have been caused by descendants of the 1918 virus, including "drifted" H1N1 viruses and reassorted H2N2 and H3N2 viruses. The latter are composed of key genes from the 1918 virus, updated by subsequently incorporated avian influenza genes that code for novel surface proteins, making the 1918 virus indeed the "mother" of all pandemics."

In some places, after one chick or table egg laying chicken tests positive with a PCR test made by IDEXX labs, the entire population they reside amongst are culled. 

Few examples:

[CBS: Bird flu prompts slaughter of 1.8 million chickens in Nebraska](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bird-flu-nebraska-1-8-million-chickens-slaughtered/)

In some states, people with their own backyard setups have to create structures to keep out wild birds; some states go as far as mandate people create online health profiles for each chicken they have, profile pics &amp; everything. If you go to the cdc website where they track H5N1, there’s a column that details what kind of bird has been infected/died; wild bird numbers barely compare to those in hatcheries &amp; other mass consumption centers.

&gt; As bird flu infections have spread in Taiwan recently, Yunlin County Magistrate Chang Li-shan, who was elected to a second term in November, has instructed related agencies to come up with preventative measures, while poultry farmers will receive financial compensation as soon as possible when their poultry are culled, the center added.

&gt; The center urged poultry farmers to keep alert over possible bird flu infections by tightening access to their farms and enhancing disinfection efforts undertaken by personnel and vehicles coming and going from the farms.

It's only a matter of time before the wrong bird cross with the wrong pig. Influenza's ability for Antigenic Shift (combination of genetic material from two separate strains) is no joke. This is the exact process that can eventually lead to a human-to-human transmissable variant of H5N1.

------------------------------------
HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported in more than 880 people with approximately 50% case fatality proportion since 1997. 

It’s not common for it to jump from birds to humans. But every additional human infection increases the odds of a new strain that *does* infect humans more easily. If CDC finds HPAI in one of your birds, they destroy all of your birds.

Er, yes, crops failing would affect livestock, but: you *do* realize we're going through another massive pandemic – bird flu?  There's a world-wide chicken shortage (and more generally poultry shortage) because Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A (H5N1) is killing huge numbers of them, and in an attempt to control it, huge numbers of domestic birds are being slaughtered. Just yesterday, the news was reporting [Japan had culled 10 million birds](https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/japan/japan-bird-flu-chickens-culling-b2258607.html) over the last two and a half years; last week the [Czech Republic culled three quarters of a million chickens](https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/European-Countries-Cull-Poultry-to-Fend-Off-Avian-Flu-20230105-0006.html), while Sweden announced intent to kill another 165k.  Here in the US: "[Colorado’s worst-ever avian flu outbreak has now resulted in nearly 6.4 million poultry deaths.](https://coloradosun.com/2023/01/09/avian-flu-colorado-birth-deaths-egg-prices/)"  That's just *today's* headlines.

People who can't get chicken and eggs are, many of them, switching to other meats (or trying to), driving those prices up too.

[German scientists found that Vitamin D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdLNMEXWTL8) increases the immune system by 3-5 times and is better than any vaccine at helping the immune system beat the H5N1 (bird flu) virus.

*In research from [PubMed: In 1981, Dr. R. Edgar Hope-Simpson](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16959053/) proposed that a 'seasonal stimulus' intimately associated with solar radiation explained the remarkable seasonality of epidemic influenza. Solar radiation triggers robust seasonal vitamin D production in the skin; vitamin D deficiency is common in the winter, and activated vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D, a steroid hormone, has profound effects on human immunity.* 

*1,25(OH)2D acts as an immune system modulator, preventing excessive expression of inflammatory cytokines and increasing the 'oxidative burst' potential of macrophages. Perhaps most importantly, it dramatically stimulates the expression of potent anti-microbial peptides, which exist in neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer cells, and in epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract where they play a major role in protecting the lung from infection. Volunteers inoculated with live attenuated influenza virus are more likely to develop fever and serological evidence of an immune response in the winter.* 

Vitamin D deficiency predisposes children to respiratory infections. Ultraviolet radiation (either from artificial sources or from sunlight) reduces the incidence of viral respiratory infections, as does cod liver oil (which contains vitamin D). An interventional study showed that vitamin D reduces the incidence of respiratory infections in children. Scientists concluded that vitamin D, or lack of it, may be Hope-Simpson's 'seasonal stimulus'. See also:

H5N1 enters the chat
2023-01-11 10:18:54
------------------------------------
Answer:

There is currently an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI or H5N1) in the US. It’s extremely deadly to birds and highly contagious, so if a single bird tests positive, the whole flock must be culled. This is making egg prices skyrocket as poultry farmers are losing millions of chickens to this disease and to culling. 

It’s also a little different compared to past HPAI outbreaks because of two factors: 1. it’s mainly transmitted directly by wild birds; and 2. It’s lasted through the summer and winter instead of dying back. Past outbreaks ended much quicker but this one just keeps on going, and is spread through the US by wild birds migrating. It’s the deadliest outbreak yet.

Edit to add: the other factors are that COVID is still impacting supply chains, inflation has driven up the prices of related factors like transporting eggs, and the holidays created even greater demand for eggs. So the egg prices would’ve already been higher but the concurrent HPAI outbreak made them skyrocket.

**Edit 2** to address some misinformation:

**Can people get HPAI?** Yes, and there has already been [at least one case](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0428-avian-flu.html) during the current (2022-2023) outbreak. It is generally very mild in people and the risk of spread among people isn't really a concern at the moment. Proper PPE is still a good idea to prevent bird-to-person-to-bird spread. [There is no risk of getting it from eating eggs or poultry that are properly prepared and cooked.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/avian-influenza-food-safety-qa.pdf) However, I believe there is a small chance that the carcasses of infected birds can transmit it to still-living birds, so if a bird is known to have had HPAI, the carcass should be cautiously disposed of.

**Why are the birds killed instead of being treated?** The nature of the disease is that it spreads rapidly and kills quickly. By the time the first bird shows symptoms, it likely spread to dozens of other birds, which will likely die within 24-48 hours. It's extremely fatal in chickens and even if treated, most would likely die. Culling the entire exposed flock is the quickest/cheapest/most efficient way of preventing the outbreak of spreading even further.

**What should I do to keep my backyard chickens/ducks/geese safe?** Do not allow them to comingle with wild birds (mostly waterfowl- songbirds are rarely affected). Keep their water and food safe from contaminants like wild goose poop. Clean your shoes before entering their enclosures so you don't bring goose poop and other contaminants into their enclosure from the outside. Track their health and if any show any neurological symptoms, isolate them immediately, disinfect anything they touch, and contact your veterinarian. Also make sure to follow the news in your state to see where and when the closest outbreak is. 

States track outbreaks by testing dead birds. This includes birds on farms, and also dead birds found in the wild or who die at a wildlife center. The amount of testing does vary wildly from state to state so some states may be more accurate than others, but unless you work for them, I'm not sure if there's really a way to find out how each states' methodology compares to the others.

------------------------------------
Here in Canada if a hen tests positive for the bird flu (h5n1), the entire flock has to be euthanized, along with any other hen within a kilometer.  Any flocks within something like 3 kilometers need to go on a sort of lock down, and are closely monitored by the government.  It's a big fucking deal.
Which is why a lot of egg producers are starting to scatter smaller farms all over the place, instead of having a 200,000 bird capacity barn

Question: Is this the same H5N1 that was in the media in 2006 ish? The one where there was even a made-for-TV doomsday movie about it? Has something changed about H5N1 that makes it only a mild concern nowadays (e.g. better immunization, more focus on other diseases like COVID/other flu viruses), or am I thinking of something different/missing something?
2023-01-11 18:29:30
------------------------------------
I'm not sure; I'm not a disease expert, but work with wild birds so have been following the current outbreak because it affects my job. All I can really say on the topic is that new strains of H5N1 are constantly evolving and the dominant strain can change from year to year. Different strains can interact with different species in new and unexpected ways. I know that right now there isn't much concern about a human outbreak, even though there has been at least one case of a person contracting the illness, but I don't know what made the 2006 strain specifically harmful to people.

Hi, there.  Amateur medievalist here.  Anyone saying we'll go back to living like we did in the 1500s is an ignorant fool. The lifestyle of the 1500s was supported by a combination of technological sophistication we arrogant moderns do not recognize as such and environmental stability we no longer enjoy.

All of the people saying, "Oh, well, we'll have to go back to living like medieval peasants", clearly have no idea where food comes from.  All of the meteorological catastrophes that have peppered the news over the last four years are *utterly ruinous* to pre-modern agriculture.  Famines use to be a regular part of life in pre-modern Europe, and that's not even with the weather chaos  we have unleashed on this planet.  There is no hiding place from flood and wildfire, drought and disease, hail and high winds.

Worse, agriculture – and even more, historical agriculture – relies on **predictability** of climate, knowing when by the sun and stars to plant, and when to reap. We have **ruined** the predictability of climate, and in doing so we have ruined our chances of falling back on subsistence farming.

And don't even get me started about what we have unleashed on livestock.  H5N1 may have ruined the viability of poultry as a source of protein, which has been historically crucial to many peasant populations.

And then there's the whole pollinator collapse thing.  And, and, and.

There is no magical back-stop in the 1500s – or the 1300s, or the 1100s, or the 900s – that will prevent us sliding all the way back to the stone age.  The only way to think there is is to have no respect for how much technical and technological knowledge they had.

People sometimes gloss over this as being "an animal disease" and fail to understand the massive ticking time bomb this is.  

Influenza has the ability to share gene segments between different strains. This is called Antigenic Shift. The danger here is that the more this H5N1 strain spreads, the greater the chance it goes through an antigenic shift that drastically alters it, potentially for the worst. All it could take is for the wrong bird to infect the wrong pig, where one of the pigs cells already infected with a different strain of influenza and is also simultaneously infected with the avian H5N1 strain. What could emerge from that cell could be a virus that makes COVID-19 feel like a mild case of allergies. The good news is that we've seen outbreaks of H5N1 in the wild before without it mutating into the strain we all fear. Chances are this outbreak will be no different, but give the virus enough opportunities to spread and it can eventually turn into the nightmare pandemic we fear.  

H5N1 is a virus that has shown the ability to cause high levels of lethality in humans (the highly pathogenic strains), easily sitting above 50% and climbing as high as 80% in some outbreaks. So far these infections have been through direct contact with infected birds and has shown very limited human to human transmission, so low it could not become a sustained epidemic. But the effects on its victims is merciless. They drown in a pool of their own liquified lungs as their bodies immune system goes haywire trying to fend off the attacking virus. Other non highly pathogenic strains of avian Influenza have fortunately been less severe, and we'll be very lucky if one of these strains becomes the one to cause an epidemic. Even then, a virus with a 15-20% fatality rate as opposed to 50% or 60% will still be devastating. And the lethality rate doesn't necessarily impact how transmissable the virus is as Influenza can spread before a person even shows any symptoms. Once it has spread, it doesn't really matter if the infected host survived or not, hence the lesser impact the fatality rate has on transmissability.  

Two "gain-of-function" research studies deliberately modified H5N1 to be transmissable between ferrets (a very close animal analog to humans) and found what would need to happen for it to spread easily between humans. All it took was for a few key mutations in the right places and you could have a very lethal and highly contagious strain of human-to-human H5N1. This was in a lab done with extremely secure measures, but nature is the ultimate biolab. If given enough opportunities, these very same or very similar mutations will eventually emerge naturally.  

For decades the one virus that has kept many epidemiologists up at night has been Influenza. Coronavirus did catch us by suprise on a number of times, with COVID being the one pandemic that wasn't exactly expected. That was because the expected and greatly feared super pandemic had been and will likely always be highly pathogenic avian Influenza. Advances in vaccine and treatment research has shortened the time it would take to respond to a pandemic, and this will save millions of lives should the worst come to pass, but until those vaccines are ready and available in mass, our world will be at the mercy of what could be the worst pandemic in human history.
2023-01-13 23:58:27
------------------------------------
Not the ones currently circulating, those are intended for seasonal strains of influenza which are different from H5N1. There is talk of a strategic reserve of experimental vaccines for a potential HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak, but those are in limited numbers and will only likely go to vital and essential sectors. New experimental mRNA vaccines are being developed, and there's some promising research into developing an omni-valent vaccine that protects the user against almost any type of Influenza A virus. Those can be a game changer and could turn influenza from a serious threat to society into nothing more than an annoyance.

Europe is in the midst of its worst-ever spate of bird flu infections with 2,500 outbreaks on farms stretching across 37 countries from October 2021-September 2022. Some 50 million birds have been culled across the continent, although the vast majority of poultry infections occurred in France.

More than twelve months since the virus was first detected in late 2021, infections have remained consistently high and show little sign of slowing. In fact, they seem to be gathering pace – European data shows that in autumn 2022 the epidemic was more virulent than the same time the previous year and the number of infected farms 35 percent higher.  

“In terms of the numbers of birds, farms, and countries affected, the number of birds that have been killed and the duration of the outbreak, the current epidemic is truly the largest we've seen in history,” says Ian Brown, chair of the joint World Organisation for Animal Health and Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN's Scientific Network on Animal Influenza.

The bird flu virus was first detected among domestic waterfowl in Southern China in 1996. Since then it has re-emerged periodically before naturally petering out ­– or being stamped out through poultry culls ­– even as it expanded its reach into Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America.  

The H5N1 strain currently circulating originated among wild birds whose migration patterns have accelerated its global propagation. The rate of reproduction is high; one bird is able to infect up to 100 others through saliva and other bodily fluids.

In Scotland, the coast provides a haven for migratory and sea birds and a crucial habitat for many endangered species. Great skuas currently have a total population of just 16,000, more than half of which inhabit the northwest coast. When numbers of the seabird started to die off in the summer of 2021 it was the first indicator that the H5N1 virus had arrived.  

At the time, authorities thought the summer outbreak was an anomaly. Then in autumn Svalbard Barnacle Geese, which migrate south from their arctic breeding ground, also started dying. “Numbers were going up by 10s, then hundreds, then more that 16,000 were confirmed dead,” says Claire Smith, policy officer for UK bird protection charity the RSPB. By spring, the organisation estimated a third of the total population had died. 

Deaths among great skuas, gannets, gulls, geese and even eagles continued through summer, by then impacting both migratory and domestic species. By July, the Scottish government had closed off access to some seabird islands. “There were just dead birds everywhere,” Smith says

Avian influenza has been around as long as birds have been around. What you said isn’t wrong but lets not just sit around and be anxious about something that may or may not happen. The stress of worrying about a future pandemic is more likely to kill you than your lungs being liquified by H5N1 at this point.
2023-01-14 05:45:36
------------------------------------
I agree. This is missing from the article - why are we culling the birds? To prevent spread - not just among bird but importantly to humans. 

The way the article paints it you'd think the culling was to protect wildlife; its not. It's partly to protect the agricultural industry (by trying to prevent spread to other farms and harming businesses; but this is a knock on effect of culling in the first place - a catch 22 situation) but very largely it is about trying to reduce human and other animal exposure (including farm animals) to the virus so we don't get mutation and transference into humans.

H5N1 is currently difficult to transmit between humans but when people do get infected the mortality rate is reportedly up to 60%. What we don't want is a shift in H5N1 where it becomes highly transmissible between people and remains highly deadly.

As you've said, Covid was a surprise, but Influenza is what we've prepared for and it has high potential to cause massive deaths. The scale and severity of the bird epidemic illustrates that.

The global bird flu pandemic of 2021 has had devastating effects on wild and farmed bird populations, with over 140 million birds killed and many endangered species at risk of extinction. Scientists, wildlife protectors and legislators are now looking for solutions to the spread of the H5N1 strain, which is highly contagious and deadly. Possible solutions include biosecurity measures, hunting restrictions and vaccinations. This global pandemic is a stark reminder of the fragility of our ecosystems and the need to take action to protect them.

------------------------------------
As for China, the defining epidemic disease may as well be influenza. Outbreaks have historically been observed to begin in Asia and spread, with a clear directionality of east to west, across the Eurasian continent. The countless examples of this are highlighted in this overview of pandemic influenza:

"[Pandemic influenza – including a risk assessment of H5N1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720801/)" (J.K. Taubenberger and D.M. Morens 2010)

The following is a study that gets into the science of the origins and circulation of specifically influenza A/H3N2 viruses. I've linked also a more "pop science" breakdown of the study, as well as a couple of relevant news reports that do a decent job describing some of the human and economic aspects of influenza in Asia.

"[The Global Circulation of Seasonal Influenza A (H3N2) Viruses](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5431638_The_Global_Circulation_of_Seasonal_Influenza_A_H3N2_Viruses)" (Colin A. Russell, Terry C. Jones, and Ian Barr 2008)

"[That Flu You Caught? It Came from East and Southeast Asia](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/that-flu-you-caught-it-ca/)" (Nikhil Swaminathan 2008)

"[Asia is traditional cradle of influenza](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4135122)" (AP 2004)

"[Is China Ground Zero for a Future Pandemic?](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/china-ground-zero-future-pandemic-180965213/)" (Melinda Liu 2017)

Interestingly, within a year after that article from 2008 was published, a novel influenza virus emerged not in Southeast Asia but rather in North America, in Mexico. This actually caught many quite off-guard, as before then all eyes had been on Asia and the threat of the so-called "bird flu", H5N1 (as evidenced in that article from 2010, which was clearly written before the 2009 pandemic despite being published after it).

Prior to 2009, tho, the pattern had generally held up thruout the 20th century: The 1957 pandemic virus was first reported in Guizhou Province, China, in February 1957, later causing a major outbreak in Hong Kong ([Payne &amp; McDonald 1958](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1889875/)); it was subsequently referred to as the "Asian influenza". Similarly, the 1968 pandemic virus caused a major outbreak in Hong Kong in July 1968, earning it the name of "Hong Kong influenza" ([Cockburn, Delon, &amp; Ferreira 1969](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2427756/)); however, it seems very probable that reported outbreaks on the mainland earlier, in the spring, were caused by the same virus, hence placing its origins also in China ([AP 1968](https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/15/archives/the-hong-kong-flu-began-in-red-china.html)). This virus, H3N2, remains with us still, by the way, as that 2008 article demonstrates, as does the pandemic H1N1 from 2009.

When it comes to the 1918 pandemic, its origins remain a mystery ([Reid &amp; Taubenberger 2003](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/vir.0.19302-0)). Hypotheses include that it could have begun in the United States (Kansas), France, or China ([Barry 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC340389/)). Barry makes a good argument for influenza breaking out in Haskell County, Kansas, in late January and early February of 1918, but I believe there's reason to be skeptical that this represents the origins of the pandemic. [Olson et al. (2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182402/) present evidence of pandemic influenza being present in New York City practically concurrently, in February of 1918, which they say is inconsistent with the Kansas origin and suggests a possible spread from Europe. Whatever exactly the case with respect to this pandemic, there's no question the majority have originated from Asia.

So, I just find the reactivity kind of curious. Why does one suggestion inspire such a skeptical response, but the other is seemingly tacitly accepted as well-established fact? The associations between China and influenza (as well as other diseases...) may be rather generally known at this point, but that's doesn't justify the reflexive cynicism of other suggested epidemiological phenomena.

Relevant, edited from a [previous comment:](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/sb3qaf/meat_production_leads_to_thousands_of_air/htzm99r?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3)

Perhaps the biggest risk of disease concerning livestock and poultry is influenza A - the only influenza virus known to cause pandemics.[\[9\]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm)  It is hypothesized that every influenza virus that causes pandemics in humans is derived from avian influenza in aquatic birds.[\[10\]](https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/152.4_Pt_2.S25)  Normally this wouldn't be an issue for us.  The infected wild birds usually don't get sick, and the virus doesn't easily spread amongst humans.[\[11\]](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(avian-and-other-zoonotic))  But industrialized animal agriculture has changed that.  One scientific review writes:

&gt;Hosts such as swine and gallinaceous poultry that are favorable for transmission and efficient replication of both zoonotic and human viruses can serve as mixing vessels and pose the greatest risk for the development of novel reassortments that can replicate competently in humans.[\[12\]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-018-0642-9)

In other words, livestock and poultry are great at making it easier for viruses to spread amongst humans.  As to why this is, one author explains:

&gt;...virtually every effort to further industrialize broiler [chicken] biology has resulted in the emergence of new risks and vulnerabilities. Intensive confinement combined with increased genetic uniformity has created new opportunities for the spread of pathogens. Increased breast-meat yield has come at the expense of increased immunodeficiency.[\[13\]](http://www.jstor.org/stable/25147798)

It is likely that animal agriculture enabled the 1957 Asian Flu, 1968 Hong Kong Flu,[\[14\]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-010-0008-z) bird flu,[\[15\]](https://dx.doi.org/10.1098%2Frstb.2018.0257) and the 2009 swine flu.[\[16\]](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08182)  Of these, bird flu is the cause for most concern.  In past outbreaks, the case-fatality (CF) rate was 60 percent, although one study suggests that if it became a larger pandemic, it would have a median CF rate of approximately 23.5 percent.[\[17\]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech.2007.064030)  It is thought that the 1918 Spanish Flu may have infected one-third of the global population and had a CF rate of 2.5 percent.[\[18\]](https://dx.doi.org/10.3201%2Feid1201.050979)  If bird flu were to mutate in such a way that it was anywhere near as contagious as Spanish Flu, with a CF rate almost 10 times higher than Spanish Flu, the results would be apocalyptic.  As two authors wrote in a WHO publication:

&gt;We can't scare people enough about H5N1 \[bird flu\].[\[19\]](https://www.psandman.com/articles/MagzEng_05.pdf)

There are a lot of people still wearing masks here in Brazil - at least in Rio de Janeiro where I live - especially the elders. I am in my 20s but I wear it too, it's better to be a bit safer than gamble some possible post covid health issues. 

But the vast majority really is over covid precautions, though I would rather we still took it more seriously since we are definitely not done with the pandemic and I really don't want to find out how we would fare against H5N1.

Wouldnt having your own chicken put you at the same risk of spreading the h5n1 strain?
2023-01-14 18:43:55
------------------------------------
Learned that the reason eggs cost so much now is because H5N1 shit is hitting the fan and it’s a 90% kill rate on birds and a 60% for humans. It hasn’t adapted to us efficiently enough just yet but you know, there are a lot of chicken farms w/human employees for it to research at the moment.

Edit: human employees
2023-01-14 19:28:29
------------------------------------
Yea but so far none have been as contagious as the Spanish flu which was far less deadly than H5N1. A variant of avian flu as contagious as Spanish flu or COVID’s new variants would devastate humanity.

It’s H5N1 so Southeast Asia. It’s enzootic(endemic, but not people) in the local bird population.
2023-01-14 21:00:58
------------------------------------
The article said it was first detected in southern China. What is it with China and viruses? Covid 19, SARS, H5N1 Bird Flu, H2N2 know as the Asian Flu, the Swine Flu and all three major waves of the plague that ravaged the world in the 6th, 14th (Black Death) and 19th centuries originated in China. It seems that with that many viruses originating from one country we need to do some root cause analysis to proactively stop future viruses.
2023-01-14 21:50:32
------------------------------------
Slightly random note, about 10 years ago there was a whole controversy within the virology community because a specific lab in the US wanted to specifically find out which mutations would make H5N1 go from birds to humans. Ethical questions arose about whether it was necessary. The mutations didn't just happen and they found it. Like they literally wanted to mutate the virus intentionally until they could get it to jump to humans.

I don't like MTG and I don't know what she's referring to here but no, the mutations at the time were not known (although I didn't really follow the rest of the story because I was no longer working in the virology field).
2023-01-14 22:13:49

Per WHO, it has a case fatality rate of 53%....

[W.H.O update from last week](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20230106.pdf?sfvrsn=5f006f99_108)

| As of 5 January 2023, a total of 240 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus have been reported from four countries within the Western Pacific Region since January 2003. Of these cases, 135 were fatal, resulting in a case fatality rate (CFR) of 56%. The last case was reported from China, with an onset date of 22 September 2022 and died on 18 October 2022. This is the first case of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported from China since 2015.
2023-01-14 22:57:46
------------------------------------
Complicated question.

The main reassortment causing more spread of avian influenza is from the Guangdong subtype which emerged in 1996. The current closest early relation to the current H5N1 strain was found in Tibet BUT the main genotype that is being found everywhere originated in ... [The Netherlands](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9246030/). So it came from everywhere as most Influenza Type A viruses do. For the US specifically, we watched it jump from Europe over the Atlantic, hit Canada, and then the East Coast before it spread westward and then south into South America.
2023-01-14 23:16:00
------------------------------------
Nearly all strains of Avian H5 can be traced to Guangdong (from 1996), but this specific strain and clade is dominated by the reassortment that occurred in The Netherlands. Saying H5N1 comes from one country simplifies influenza WAY too much. There's a reason these strains are further typed by their origin in the subclades.
2023-01-14 23:21:00
------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; We can't scare people enough about H5N1

I remember hearing people saying COVID couldn't possibly be as bad as they claimed and some scientists saying, "Listen, we figured something even worse was going to happen soon, so you'll probably see how bad it can get within your lifetime."

"The Big One" for this millennium has yet to drop, it's kind of overdue, and conditions are worse than ever for its likely severity and outcome.
2023-01-14 23:47:45
------------------------------------
Avian flu is heavily present in wild birds (here in WA they were asking people not to put up bird feeders because it causes them to congregate and spread faster).  I mention this because if you start raising chickens, it's entirely likely they will get H5N1 as well and now you have your own personal carriers you get to spend time with every day.
2023-01-15 00:24:19
------------------------------------
Wouldnt having your own chicken put you at the same risk of spreading the h5n1 strain?
2023-01-15 00:30:06
------------------------------------
Theoretically yes, but H5N1 has a 60% morality rate in humans so there was the fear that once the mutations were known, anyone could create the virus and then release it to the public. And mutating a virus in vitro honestly isn't that hard. I did it a few times in grad school. So that's where the ethical debate came from. Was it worth it to know the mutations of something with such a high mortality rate knowing it may be used maliciously in the future?

Plus, were already knew the vaccine targets for H5N1 because it's literally in the name. So it was a "what's really the point" type debate.
2023-01-15 01:54:52
------------------------------------
Shilling for pharma?
We have seen countless of times they manufactured fear and panic to fool people they need vaccines. Just look at last fiasco with H5N1.

Interesting tidbits:

* Cal-Maine has not been affected by H5N1. So while overall market supply has dropped (which raises prices) they have been able to ride it out and profit handsomely.

* Quarterly gross profit *margin* of 39.6%, versus 11.4% the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

* Net income of $198 million, versus $1.1 million previous year

* Net price for *conventional* eggs is now significantly greater than that of their *specialty* eggs, which doesn't make much sense.

[Recent reports](https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20230113-largest-global-bird-flu-outbreak-in-history-shows-no-sign-of-slowing) suggest that the largest global bird flu outbreak in history continues into 2023. [A timely announcement by the WHO](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20230106.pdf?sfvrsn=5f006f99_108) suggest a 56% fatality rate on humans infected by the H5N1 virus.

I found [this incredible summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/10bxr0f/comment/j4d7kst/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) of the situation by u/Plant__Eater in r/news about the bird flu situation, and decided to research the topic. This study, titled: *Alarming situation of emerging H5 and H7 avian influenza and effective control strategies,* also explains the origin of the viruses causing the current pandemic. But there is an even more interesting point.

An excerpt from this paper in question:

&gt;Epidemiology studies have shown that humans become infected mainly through exposure to virus-infected poultry or a contaminated environment ; human-to-human transmission has been very limited. Therefore, before the H5 and H7 viruses acquire the ability to transmit from human to human, control of these viruses in animals is essential and effective to prevent them from infecting humans.
2023-01-15 09:15:42
------------------------------------
So far infections with this strain have been rare and mild in humans (let's hope it stays that way), but it is very deadly to poultry and many wild birds. This is one reason egg and chicken prices are soaring.

&gt;A lethal bird flu outbreak that has been circling the globe since 2021 peaked in Japan this week, as an agriculture ministry official said on Tuesday the country plans to cull more than 10 million chickens at risk of exposure to the virus. 

&gt;Flu is a common annual illness among wild birds yet the H5N1 strain now sweeping Japan is uniquely contagious and deadly. It poses such high risk to farmed birds, such as chickens and turkeys, that a single infection on a farm condemns the entire flock to be killed. As outbreaks in Japan have reached a record high, the cull is the largest ever planned for the yearly flu season that runs from October to May.  

&gt;Around the globe, record-breaking death tolls due to the virus are becoming the norm. In the US, more states than ever before have reported instances of bird flu with an all-time high of nearly 58 million poultry affected as of January 2023. 

&gt;Meanwhile, Europe is in the midst of its worst-ever spate of bird flu infections with 2,500 outbreaks on farms stretching across 37 countries from October 2021-September 2022. Some 50 million birds have been culled across the continent, although the vast majority of poultry infections occurred in France.

&gt;More than twelve months since the virus was first detected in late 2021, infections have remained consistently high and show little sign of slowing. In fact, they seem to be gathering pace – European data shows that in autumn 2022 the epidemic was more virulent than the same time the previous year and the number of infected farms 35 percent higher.

For whatever reason my comments in this very post aren't showing up after 50 minutes. I'll try to share some of the information without the sources and source it [in this other post.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Unethical_Orange/comments/10clz6i/avian_influenza_viruses_of_the_h5_subtype_and_h7/)

Recent reports suggest that the largest global bird flu outbreak in history continues into 2023. A timely announcement by the WHO described a 56% fatality rate on humans infected by the H5N1 virus. According to the FAO, we bred 119 billion chickens last year alone.

Lab meat is no guarantee that it will always be clean and safe.  There has been several cases of tainted medicines that have been produced and caused people to die.  The worst and egregious case I remember was when Bayer found out they had tons of a blood clotting medication tainted by HIV and sold them to Latin America and Asia to still make a profit. [Article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bayer-sold-hiv-risky-meds/) I have worked in biotech labs before and people or machine can fuck up all the time.  

When population grow, disease is a common factor to thin the herd.  Easy solutions to this problem would be scale back size or isolate out the colonies more to reduce disease spread.  Hard solution would be to integrate lab grown egg and H5N1 or universal flu vaccine into egg farming

Just wait till the H5N1 starts spreading! We'll lose MILLIONS!
2023-01-15 16:59:03
------------------------------------
It's out there.  I don't think we have a great idea how common it is but we are looking for it.

&gt;On January 14, 2022, USDA announced finding H5N1 bird flu in an American wigeon in South Carolina, marking the first detection of this virus in wild birds in the United States since 2016.

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/wildbirds.htm
2023-01-15 17:52:32
------------------------------------
Woah seriously? The H5N1 conversation has been pretty strong in the farming groups I'm a part of for over a year. If they have even one case on their farm, the state has to come and euthanize all of them. Then you can't have any new animals for a certain amount of time. They want to make sure the virus dies before introducing new birds. People can also catch it and it's not pretty. You want the state to come in as well. All those birds are going to die horrible deaths otherwise. I believe some ducks get very I'll but some live. But then they become carriers, so they still need to be euthanized. It's a really sucky heartbreaking situation. I have free range chickens and don't have a great way to "lock them down" if there are cases in the area.
2023-01-15 19:40:02
------------------------------------
That Strain must be called H5N1 Kush. Short for Bird Flu Kush.
2023-01-15 22:16:20
------------------------------------
Just waiting for everyone to realize it’s high because we’ve had to kill about 160 million birds due to H5N1. I imagine most of the farms that were destroyed in fires etc.  it was cheaper to burn it than kill everything. It would all be contaminated
2023-01-16 01:23:19
------------------------------------
the H5N1 flu that's causing the egg shortage has infected several hundred people since 2006 and has a case fatality rate of \~50%. all you need is a few mutations that boost transmissibility within human populations and you've got the genuine apocalypse ![img](emote|t5_2th52|28239)
2023-01-16 02:15:08

These past few weeks, may threads akong nababasa about sa pagspike ng price ng eggs sa US due to H5N1 virus. Wouldn't be surprised if eto ang susunod dito sa Pinas.
2023-01-16 10:52:56
------------------------------------
Does anyone realize that there is a widespread issue with H5N1, a really deadly form of avian fle, ravaging farms and wild birds? How come nobody talks about this ever when discussing chicken and egg prices??  
Everyone is complaining why prices are so high but nobody ever brings up the reason, and that's one of the big reasons, if not the biggest reason.
2023-01-16 13:10:31
------------------------------------
From what I know H5N1 wasn't ravaging hundreds of chicken farms across Canada a couple years ago. That's the reason why prices for poultry products have skyrocketed. The farms are making less money cuz so many of their chickens are dying and you can't sell diseased meat. It's a horrible disease and extremely potent at spreading and killing.
2023-01-16 13:17:34

WORRIED ABOUT COVID-19? NO PROBLEM! WORRIED ABOUT THE MONKEYPOX?! NOT A CHANCE! WORRIED ABOUT YOUR LOVED ONES CATCHING RSV?! NOT WITH OUR STATE OF THE ART DRYER! H5N1?! NOT NO ONE WITH OUR ADVANCED SANITIZING FEATURE!
2023-01-16 16:17:02
------------------------------------
&gt;	Hope it doesn’t make a jump to us

I'm praying it doesn't make the jump to us. And I'm agnostic. 

This strain (H5N1) has about a 60% case fatality rate.... sixty. 

Granted, that is a low sample size (900 people) but even covid, at the beginning, when we knew nothing about it, appeared to have a 3.4% CFR in March. Covid looks like nothing compared to the avian flu.
2023-01-16 17:04:03
------------------------------------
That bird flu is H5N1. 60% mortality when jumping into humans. Definitely something you don't want infecting a lot of poultry workers and mutating towards human-to-human transmission.

The EFSA (European Food Safety Agency) said it's the worst outbreak ever registered
2023-01-16 22:16:37

If any of you judgemental pieces of shite were in the limelight as Norm was, or dealing with the ravaging effects of corticosteroids, I daresay you would have avoided cameras at all costs or had plastic surgery yourselves. Methinks you're all jealous, small and petty, and may you all acquire horrible cases of VD. I wish I could wish death upon you, but I'm not geared that way. But H5N1? Sure. Long live Norm.
2023-01-16 22:21:46
------------------------------------
I've had my H5N1 vaccine, so where can I get those worthless bird flu eggs?
2023-01-16 23:19:16
------------------------------------
Japan is dealing with H5N1 (bird flu) right now, makes sense this would be happening in China as well. Same migration route.
2023-01-17 00:02:41
------------------------------------
US has a major outbreak of H5N1 also. Affecting the chickens and people with flu type A
2023-01-17 05:32:12
------------------------------------
Still, to my point, how does cage-free mitigate risk of HPAI?

So maybe not thousands of birds in a flock, maybe only hundreds, but does small-scale, distributed production mitigate risk, and is that a superior economic model overall? In California, we have restrictions on how close poultry operations can be from each other, but exception is made for flocks of less than 500.

Besides, it doesn't seem like the issue is scale or proximity to other commercial operations, it is the fact that "Based on current disease surveillance and epidemiology, wild waterfowl and raptors remain the largest threat of Eurasian H5N1 introduction to domestic poultry in California." https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/AHFSS/Animal\_Health/avian\_health/pdfs/122922\_AI\_Poultry\_Producers\_Separation\_web.pdf

There are advantages to both large and small-scale production, we need both.
2023-01-17 17:06:44
------------------------------------
&gt;Still, to my point, how does cage-free mitigate risk of HPAI?

Reread the person's original statement. They never specifically mentioned cage-free. They just noted that the chickens are being kept in the cheapest possible conditions, bunched together. Their first two sentences were very clear on what their driving point was:

&gt;In fairness, it's exactly the system that worked to produce $1/dozen eggs that is responsible for the crazy egg prices of today. We created an egg production schema that was built for total efficiency at the expense of all resiliency

More expensive accomodations, regardless of whether they're cage free or not, would alleviate the issue. More protections from contact with wild waterfowl, separation of flocks into smaller chucks, etc. There are things they could have done to mitigate this issue, but never did because they focused on keeping prices rock bottom. That's the point being made.
 
You're arguing a strawman- assuming that their criticism of "cheapest possible setups" implies that they're advocating cage-free and only cage-free.

&gt;it is the fact that "Based on current disease surveillance and epidemiology, wild waterfowl and raptors remain the largest threat of Eurasian H5N1 introduction to domestic poultry in California."

I'm quite aware of this already. If you read my comment again, you'll notice that the biggest thing I've done for my own girls is put up protections against wild waterfowl getting anywhere near their enclosures. But that costs money, and spending money is the antithesis of large-scale producers' strategy.
2023-01-17 19:44:45
------------------------------------
Any mammal like bears, foxes, big cats etc that contract H5N1 get euthanized here in the US, it’s some sad shit that there’s no cure or therapeutic options for them.
2023-01-18 08:42:19

The most charitable number I found after some googling was [56%](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20230106.pdf?sfvrsn=5f006f99_108) (pdf warning) case fatality rate in humans (for H5N1).
2023-01-18 14:19:26
------------------------------------
We don't know that this is specifically H5N1, though.

Edit: We do now.

2023-01-18 14:26:08
------------------------------------
The CDC stockpiles H5N1 and H7N9 human vaccines. 

They are working on a vaccine that can be given to chickens and livestock.
2023-01-18 15:07:56
------------------------------------
H5N1 has developed strong resistance to Tamiflu. Tamiflu is pretty much useless when used against the current strain of Avian flu.
2023-01-18 17:04:53
------------------------------------
60%  for H5N1

https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2500029-overview#a4

&gt;The extraordinarily high mortality rate of avian influenza (&gt;60% for H5N1; approximately 30% for H7N9) is worrying and reasonably accurate. There have been very few instances of seropositive individuals without clinical signs of infection.
2023-01-18 17:21:21
------------------------------------
You’re blaming Biden for the effects of an avian flu that started spreading during the Bush administration?  H5N1 has been spreading since the early 2000s and recently crossed over from wild to domestic birds.  Now it is driving up the cost of eggs because it’s killing the hens.
2023-01-18 19:15:13
------------------------------------
That's for other most other mammals. They have [H5N1 vax for humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5N1_vaccine)and have had it for a while.
2023-01-18 22:54:21
------------------------------------
H5N1 is about 50% CFR globally. Not a huge sample size in developed countries either. Only like 850 or so total human infections globally. 

Still fucking bad though.

Edit- different (worse) flu. My bad.

Edit 2- nope it’s H5N1 that they’re just calling something else for some reason.
2023-01-18 22:56:52
------------------------------------
I am over 40 and remember well every few years there is a major-ish avian flu outbreak. I remember it a lot on the TV news in the early 2000's especially. And when the larger ones happen, there is always news stories about the possibility of it evolving human-to-human transmissibility. Not saying it never will and to take the vax for granted, just saying that H5N1 is the base strain and whatever variant arises that develops the human-to-human trait, at least we will have a partially working VAX and also a good base to start with.

In the last 20 years H5N1 has killed less than 500 people globally, although yes, the mortality rate when you get it and aren't vaccinated is quite high, depending too what country you are in. So it shouldn't be trivialized at all, but in another sense I am also glad we have some groundwork laid should it ever change in that way.
2023-01-18 23:21:02
------------------------------------
&gt; Have you had a chicken crisis or something that was not talked about in international news?

Yep. That's exactly what happened. Millions of birds have been culled to stop the avian H5N1 bird flu. 

The problem is the prices won't ever go back down even in a year when production is back up. Once they see people will pay those prices, that's the new price floor forever.
2023-01-19 10:02:19
------------------------------------
It already does.  HPAI is also known as H5N1, it's the same "bird flu" that swept through populations several years ago after SARS.

It's normally hard to jump from birds to people.  That's why the government forces hatcheries and farms to completely depopulate their flocks when it's discovered, and they usually do it in a way to prevent workers from being exposed for too long.

We can't get it under control, though, because it spreads easily between wild birds, and you've got legions of backyard raisers now who are still high off the "COVID IS A HOAX", "GUBBERMINT CONSPIRACIES!", and "VACCINES ARE BAD" messaging from certain .... parties .... and they won't cull their sick birds and hardheadedly refuse to take basic biosecurity measures like covering feed, because they think HPAI isn't real or that the government is trying to control them.

TLDR:  People are fucking stupid.
2023-01-19 13:34:01
------------------------------------
As well as those three bears in Montana, H5N1 has recently been found in raccoons, coyotes and foxes in various states in the US; dolphins, seals, foxes and waterfowl all over Europe, in Russia and Japan. It’s a pretty bad outbreak.
2023-01-19 14:51:48
------------------------------------
There have been several human cases over the years, even one human to human transmission but luckily it ended there. 

Once it starts spreading from human to human relatively easily then we are in big trouble. 

I’ve been keeping an eye on H5N1 since I was 17 years old and saw a show about infectious disease and they suspected that H5N1 would kill 2/3rds of the worlds population once it could easily spread from human to human. 

I’m not sure if they still think it will kill 2/3rds of the worlds population but that stuck with me from a young age so I got a twitter account and later set of google alerts to help myself monitor the situation. 

It’s definitely something to keep watching and listening for.
2023-01-19 15:41:36
------------------------------------
H5n1 will make covid look like the mild flu the idiots claimed it was. I shudder to think what will happen.

Highly pathogenic avian flu is infecting bears

Fun facts:

- 2023 Avian flu is spicy enough to weaken/kill a healthy young bear. A fucking bear. Think how tough a bear is. Just imagine, that bear survived memes and superstonks and spacs and ARKK manias but then just as it was winning, it eats a tasty sparrow for brekkies and ... gg ber.

- They went blind jfc, it's fucking neuroinvasive

- The current circulating strain is H5N1. Historically, humans infected by H5N1 Avian flu had a case fatality rate of around 60%. Whereas humans infected by e.g. H7N9 Avian flu had a case fatality rate of merely 22%. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4001451/). So this current avian flu pandemic is potentially a scary one.

SS: well, we've had some articles on HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza, aka bird/avian flu, aka h5n1) on the front page lately. It's good to see the awareness spread; imma add to it. 

1) HPAI is raging across bird populations worldwide rn, increasing the risk of a spillover event.

2) HPAI has been passed from birds to many species of mammals including humans at increasing rates since 2022-2023: skunk, bear, fox, wildcats, coyote, and even seals and dolphins.

3) it's not real good (yet) at passing from human to human.

4) this to my knowledge is the first documented mammal-to-mammal transmission. We are, of course, also mammals. If HPAI strains are getting better at passing between mammals (vs being predominantly hosted in birds), that's one step closer to jumping to us.

5) based on what limited data we have, HPAI has a 60+% case fatality rate in humans. Compare and contrast covid which has &lt;5% cfr. When HPAI jumps to us we will all understand how covid was EZmode pandemic. Casual mode. Scrub mode.

This one scares me. I mean really scares me. Collapse related because we're looking at facing a civilisation-ending plague. Not all humanity, i mean, but the sort of thing that helped to end the Bronze Age civilisations.
