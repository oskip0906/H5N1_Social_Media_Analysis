With H5N1, I would do a hard lockdown, Mar 2020-style. No-contact everything, no indoor anything. I would make myself as comfortable as possible in my home and not leave until absolutely necessary.

I'm assuming the general public would roll their eyes and go about their business for a good long while, allowing the virus to spread widely &amp; rapidly. I think people will pay far less attention than early 2020, until it is too late. Then, maybe the virus will be taken more seriously- one would hope anyway.

Spread of avian flu to mammals isn't super surprising ...nor is it common; it's rare. (The news reports can make it seem otherwise... they don't report on the billions of mammals that aren't sick after all lol).

It's one thing to infect a creature of another species. Entirely another level to be able to spread from there to other members of that species.

Who knows if it would have jumped to humans in Spain if they weren't masking up to prevent them from giving covid to the mink!

An article on a French cat getting this kind of pointed out the dangers of recombination how people who work with potentially infectious birds should be getting the regular flu shot so they are less likely to have both at the same time giving them a chance to make a mutation that could then jump between us humans. So if you haven't already get your flu shot for the season and see if you can encourage housemates friends family etc go ahead and do it if it's available in your country. At the very least it will protect you against flu and you don't have to worry about having flu as a co-infection with any other regular infection going around

Even longer if it starts in a foreign country (I am from USA). Hopefully after the big wave, people would hunker down and take quarantine measures seriously.

"Hi everyone, this is my first ever post so please excuse any issues that may arise. I�m an aspiring MD/PhD with a focus in immunology. I�m posting this article from Eurosurveilance that details the genetics of the mink farm outbreak in October 2022. It�s very jargon heavy, and I realize that this is not a science focused community, so parts of it may be tough to read for some of you. If that is the case I�d love to have a discussion about it.

TLDR: The mink farm genetics from the H5N1 outbreak bear at least one mutation that is beneficial to mammalian infection. This is a mutation to the 271st amino acid of the polymerase protein (T271A). This point mutation was also observed in the 2009 swine flu, which occurred when an avian flu and a human flu infected a pig. This mutation has also been observed to be positively correlated with a second, much more impactful, mutation to the hemagglutinin protein (HA at position 226). In model flu strains this second mutation enables the influenza virus to bind human receptors. Last major point, the mink farm mutation (T271A) is so far rare, but was also seen in a European Polecat that was collected from a different site.

What does this mean? Well, maybe not a lot. But also, maybe the virus is accumulating mutations to important enzymatic active sites that confer greater suitability to mammalian hosts. If these continue then there�s a chance, albeit somewhat small at this point, that mammal to mammal transmission could become efficient, potentially even in humans. The mink incident was particularly frightening because mink have similar respiratory systems to humans and they can coinfect with the H5N1 and human influenza viruses. If this occurs then the viruses could undergo a process called reassortment,  which could dramatically speed up the fitness that any emerging viruses have for mammals. This is similar to what happened in 2009, and probably what happened in 1918, and both involved avian influenzas.

I think it�s important to not be to alarmists, but to also take this very seriously. This could blow over, and similar close calls with this same virus have in the past. Either way, the article linked above is a great investigation into the science of what is happening, and I thought it would be good to share with this community.

Please feel free to send me questions about it if the language is too opaque.",2023-02-11 16:47:25,concerned
Sorry I just joined and only heard about the H5N1 issues like.. last week. Would our regular flu vaccines not be enough to take care of this?,2023-02-11 17:13:32,concerned
"It�s really tough to predict unfortunately. Obviously carnivorous mammals that ingest infected birds are at greatest risk. Especially those that live communally, as they have a greater opportunity to pass from one to the next. This is why the mink, the sea lions, and the seals are so concerning. It�s also why most of the infected mammals have been carnivores thus far. Even humans have had sparingly few human to human transmission of H5N1, though not recently.

Influenza binds to complex sugars called sialic acid receptors. These are ubiquitous across mammals and birds, but they can have subtle differences from one species to the next and even from one location in a species to the next. Viral binding in one species does not necessarily mean it will bind in another, and to be honest a zoologist would be better at answering your question.

As far as livestock goes, cows and pigs in close confines exposed to virus from bird droppings could be probably be infected, but not terribly easily. Pigs are omnivorous, and could eat dead birds. Cows are often fed chicken meal, and that can be contaminated as well. Those both pose a risk for sure, but since we haven�t seen it happen yet this makes it seem like it�s been well managed so far.

Domestic cats and dogs that access dead birds are a big concern. Cats have already been infected a lot by this, and they love birds. As it stands now, it�s unlikely they�d pass it to a human owner unless they were  in very close prolonged contact. The receptors that the current H5N1 binds to in humans is very deep down in our airways and tough to access, but not impossible. Keep your cats inside if you can!

Probably not gonna see a animal collapse anytime soon, but I�m a biochemist not a veterinarian so I�m not the best suited to answer. Hope this helps.",2023-02-11 17:48:42,concerned

"That certainly sounds scary for sure. Even scarier is them having H5N1 influenza and a common human flu that one of the workers brought in. The unique biology of the influenza genome allows them to do something called reassortment, when one influenza virus picks up parts of the other one. In this way they can rapidly shift genetics and emerge very differently. Fortunately, influenza and coronavirus don�t combine in this way. Influenza is a negative sense RNA virus while Coronaviruses are plus sense RNA, that and other features make it so that they can�t take part in reassortment.

"Well, to be clear, the T271A mutation has only be observed twice in the literature above. Once in the mink, once in a polecat in Europe. The HA mutation has not been observed in H5N1 yet, to my knowledge. Rather, this HA mutation was correlated with the same T271A mutation in lab models. Or that is how I understood it from the paper. It�s in the discussion section if you want to check it out for yourself.

As for your questions. Mutations are stochastic, and we can�t do a lot to prevent them in nature. I�m the past, with other avian flus that were more restricted to poultry, aggressive vaccination campaigns were sufficient to arrest further spread. Europe has a history with this. Unfortunately, this virus underwent a few critical mutations that made it far more efficient at infecting wild birds, and this is what led to it becoming much more widespread. Up till a few years ago it was more restricted to poultry, with sporadic wild bird infections, at least that is how I understand it. Now that it�s in the wild fowl it�s able to spread outside of the control of human managed farms. This has led to a lot of headaches in the egg industry as we all know. Farmers are having a hard time isolating flocks from wild birds, and this has led to record die offs. On the biochemical side of all that, this means there is a lot more opportunity for replication. Each replication event is another opportunity for mutations, and though most mutations are detrimental to fitness, occasionally one lands in the right place at the right time. Like say for instance T271A or an HA mutation at the sialic acid binding domain. If that occurs and then a mammal eats that specific dead bird then it could go on to replicate in an environment where those mutations are beneficial rather than detrimental. Any individual specific event is very unlikely, but with enough events it eventually becomes a distinct possibility. Unfortunately, the time to have done something to arrest that would have been before H5N1 spilled over into wild birds, and it could have been achieved with widespread vaccination of poultry. But, that�s expensive, and the prices go up, and basically factory farming could lead to a pandemic now.

There are vibrant vaccine production programs starting up, but they�re all kinda waiting to see what spills out to ramp up. As you probably know, influenza vaccines don�t maintain efficacy for long. There is work on a pan-influenza vaccine, but it�s gonna take time, and there�s no guarantee.

We can take steps as individuals. We can be vigilant for bird and animal die off and promptly report them so that scientists can get to work on characterizing any genetics that may portend dangerous changes. We can wear masks and wash our hands when we�re sick, and stay home. We can aggressively lobby for paid sick leave for everyone. But none of that stops the chance mutations from occurring.

I guess I�ll say this too. Humanity�s history is punctuated by the emergence of diseases, mostly viral or bacterial. Even if we could stop this one, another would come. Not to be fatalistic, but that�s nature. The best we can hope for is that this particular one doesn�t land, cause it�s a bad one, really real bad. That said so is Nippah virus, and there are cousins of the measles that pop up occasionally that are very scary, and then the many beta-coronaviruses that could be terrible. Recall that MERS had a 30% mortality and it�s still out there, SARS-1 had about a 10% and chances are it�s lurking in nature still as well. The thing that makes H5N1 such a salient threat right now is that it�s global, and it�s historically high case fatality.",2023-02-11 22:03:10,concerned
"It glitched out before I could add this. Yes, the clock can absolutely tick away from disaster naturally. H5N1 is just as likely, possibly even more likely, to mutate away from human fitness. And for that matter, if it does jump in to humans, especially via reassortment with a coinfected human influenza, then the case fatality is likely to drop. Not a guarantee on that either, but that is what tends to happen. Unfortunately that drop could be from 56% to 55% or to 0.1%, or anything in between.

"Thanks for posting this, it was an interesting read. Here are some of my thoughts.

The investigation found that 84% of Javan poultry workers had antibodies to a 2012-2014 strain of H5N1, and that none of them had severe or acute symptoms. While this is good news for the current situation, it was an older clade of the virus. The nature of the illnesses described seems to support the idea that that particular strain was inefficient at replicating or entering human cells. The mid 2010�s did see a drop off in H5N1 cases among humans. Prior to that a large outbreak (a couple hundred cases) occurred in Egypt, and that led to a large number of deaths. This seems to point to an evolution away from humans in the early 2010�s. It would be interesting to see if non-human mammalian deaths were similarly affected. Of course, at that point the virus was also much less suited to wild fowl, so less carnivorous and scavenging mammalian interactions would have occurred. As we all know, farmers discourage carnivorous mammal interactions with their flocks. One thing that could have contributed to the relative protection of these workers could have been a persistent exposure to sub-infectious levels of H5N1 from poultry interactions. This could induce a healthy B-cell response prior to any larger exposures and confer protection to the workers. Unfortunately, the authors neglected to disclose the balance of IgG to IgM antibodies, or what the levels of memory B and T cells were in the serum. This would have helped to differentiate between a low pathogenicity and high levels of protection conferred by repeated low level exposure. Despite that, they did a good job on the study, kudos to them.

The real pertinent question to today is, has this favorable mutation away from human pathogenicity continued or reversed? Hopefully it has, but the virulence observed in the mink farm in October seems to contradict this.

One thing we can all take away that is very positive is that case fatality rates are not typically accurate. Mild or sub clinical infections tend to go unreported. Out of the severe infections there is a 53-56% mortality, based upon less than 1000 known infections over the course of two decades. If there were another 1000-10000 cases of mild infections then this virus� case fatality is in fact much less than originally reported. This all illustrates just how challenging epidemiology is.

All that said, anything over 1% can be very devastating if it spreads well, as we saw with SARS-Cov-2. Also, H5N1 may potentially be evolving towards greater pathogenicity, and the typical human lacks the kind of persistent interaction with poultry that could�ve helped protect these workers. In fact, scientists have observed similar seropositivity to rabies among populations of people living in regions of S. America. Those populations have gained some resistance to a virus that has a near 100% mortality in other populations. Nobody seems to have a good answer as to how this occurred. Immune systems are complicated!",2023-02-12 12:54:06,supportive
That�s a very good point about the lack of reported mild infections skewing results. One can only hope the media exercises the same critical thought instead of headline grabbing hysteria should H5N1 make the jump.

"You know your awesome post made me think of a few other things.

We�re considering getting a few lifestraws, we live in the country and have a pond and if thing�s really went off the rails then each of them is approved for 1000 gallons. They�re fairly cheap too, so it�s worth the price. That�s a lot of drinking water! Remember, you must have water, fat, protein, carbs, and essential vitamins to survive a long isolation (and oxygen but that goes without saying).

You mentioned medicine, especially cold and flu medicine. Top of that list is fever reducers, remember to get more than one type so that you can alternate if you have to! If it�s possible to access some broad-spectrum antibiotics to store in the freezer that�d be awesome. Amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. Those three cover different things, but between them you have protection against nearly every common bacterial infection. You might be able to find a physician friend or vet that will help, or the dark web if you�re savvy, and as long as you know the dosages per kg of mass and the course length you can self self administer. A working scale is important for dosing! Same with tamiflu, it works on H5N1. For that matter prednisone or dexamethasone, both could save your life from a severe immune system overreaction from H5N1, though timing is key as they can also knock down the immune system and lead to excessive viral replication. If possible it�s best to let the doctor handle that, but if the health care system completely collapses then that is not an option. One would have to find case reports for the timing and dosages, but in an emergency you do what you have to do. Plaster and gauze, sterile stitching, and a sterile razor could all also save your life if the hospitals are overwhelmed. For that matter compression bandages and superglue to seal cuts not bad enough for stitching. Compile notes on how to administer these types of first aid, they�re free on the internet and tend to be good. Or buy a textbook on emergency care, that�d be the best resource. Learn CPR, if you can afford it get an emergency defibrillator. If it really hits, and it remains highly lethal, a lot of doctors and nurses will simply die or abandon posts, so knowing how to stop bleeding or set a break could save you or your family�s life. If the hospitals did have a catastrophic failure then it�s fair to assume it would take a really long time to get back to working order, so having the basics of emergency care covered is important for a long haul.

To be totally clear about all that, it only applies if the hospitals completely fail and there are no other options!!! Don�t self administer any of those unless it is an absolute last resort. Hopefully it doesn�t come to that. Also this is not medical advice!

Ammunition if you hunt, and a good hunting knife for dressing.

Lastly, entertainment. I have a child and wife and months inside leads to the crazies! We�re making sure we have complete decks of cards, board games, lots of candles and kerosene for light, and good books should power fail for a long time. If you�re alone, a crank radio or battery radio to keep in touch  with other people if the power went out for a long time. We are social creatures and mental health is important.

Thanks for getting my wheels turning on this! I�m so focused on the science that I hadn�t put the thought into how to dig in for a long time. I�m sure I could come up with more.",2023-02-13 11:52:01,concerned
"Yes, antibiotics are for bacteria, absolutely. Unfortunately it can be tough to determine if an internal infection is bacterial or viral, even with proper training it is still a frequent problem. Tamiflu only works on influenza. Also, steroids can be very very dangerous to administer! All good points! In the end there�s no way to eliminate all risks. For hunting as an example, wearing gloves and a mask, and proper cooking would be essential. With that said, you gotta eat! Also, with the state of our meat packing industry, there�s a good risk it would fail. CoVid death rates were way higher in that industry and I doubt it�d fare better in H5N1. Hopefully we never have to worry about that.

You could gravity feed water through a lifstraw to filter out organics and bacteria, then boil or treat with any of a number of agents to cover the viruses, you could also set it in direct sunlight for a few days if nothing else, or even just wait a full 10 days. That�d cover a lot of other viruses too, not just influenza. There are some better filters but they cost so much! Also a lot of them require electricity for UV treatment. If we�re talking thunder dome level they�d probably turn into paper weights.

"As I've said, I'm a public health student, so I'm not working professionally yet.

However, I have heard a few concerning things and that's made me step up my prepping game. Mostly, it is information that is available to the general public that is concerning me. This includes the spreading of bird flu between mink. Mink have a respiratory system much closer to human's respiratory system, so it signals that the virus is mutating in ways that could lead to human-to-human transmission in the future. That, coupled with how many seals and other mammals have been found to have it recently is my main cause for alarm.

Information that I have that the general public does not have is really only speculation. One of my professors is one of my state's specialists on zoonotic diseases and she suddenly closed all her office hours because she had unexpected meetings (probably nothing, but it made me wonder). Several of my professors have also shifted our curriculum to include response measures to H5N1, which has me thinking it is on their minds as well. Lastly, in general, as a public health student focusing on health promotion and planning, I have been taught how to ""tailor messages"" for the public. While I know I'm being taught this to help keep people from panicking, it makes me very aware that the messages of CDC, WHO etc., are being tailored for the public (and for me) in a way that is trying to prevent concern. I appreciate that they are trying to help, but I have always liked telling the whole truth more than a more paternalistic approach.

What Are the Odds H5N1 Is Worse Than COVID?

And what can we do to reduce that risk?

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Executive Summary

The chance of H5N1 or one of its descendants causing a pandemic is slim, but the impact would probably be more severe than COVID

A reasonable forecast that H5N1 causes a pandemic as bad as or worse than COVID beginning in the next year is ~4%, which means the expected cost in terms of potential harms to the U.S. is�at least�$640 billion

The federal government can reduce that risk by:�

"&gt; Seven sporadic human cases associated with poultry exposures during this outbreak of contemporary HPAI A(H5N1) viruses have been reported globally since January 2022, one of which was identified in the United States. In four of these cases, no respiratory symptoms were reported. It is possible that some of these cases did not represent virus infection but rather detection of non-infectious H5N1 virus genetic material in respiratory specimens following prolonged exposure to infected birds. In three cases, severe disease occurred, including one death. No human-to-human spread of H5N1 virus was identified in any of these cases. Sporadic human infections with contemporary H5N1 viruses are not surprising, especially among people who do not take recommended precautions (such as wearing personal protective equipment, including respiratory protection, for example). Since 1997, more than 880 human cases, nearly all from previously circulating H5N1 virus clades, have been reported from 21 countries with high mortality, but very few cases have been identified worldwide since 2016. A small number of sporadic human infections with H5N1 virus does not change the risk to the general public, which CDC currently considers to be low.",2023-02-15 13:02:09,concerned

SYMPTOMS IN HUMANS

&gt;According to guidelines issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for animal handlers, signs of bird flu include difficulty breathing, vomiting, fever, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, eye infection, muscle aches, abdominal pain and pneumonia or other severe respiratory infections. The CDC states lab testing is needed to diagnose bird flu in humans and cannot be done by symptoms alone as they mimic symptoms of other diseases and infections. Physicians diagnose bird flu by swabbing the nose or throat, and the results are more accurate if done within the first few days of the illness. The lower respiratory tract (i.e. the lungs, bronchi and windpipes) may be tested

HOW TO STAY SAFE

&gt;As of January, only 240 cases of bird flu in humans have been reported worldwide since 2003, according to WHO. The only human case found in the U.S. was reported in Colorado in April 2022, and the patient recovered after a few days. They were treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral flu medication. To avoid infection, the CDC recommends avoiding direct contact with wild birds, reporting dead birds that appear to be sick to authorities, safely preparing poultry and cooking it all the way through and getting a yearly flu vaccination. Bird owners and hunters should use protective gear like gloves and N95 masks; wash their hands thoroughly; avoid touching the nose, mouth and eyes after coming into contact with birds and change their clothes before coming in contact with any bird.

ARE BIRD FLU VACCINES AVAILABLE?

&gt;There are a few vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Adjuvented, manufactured by ID Biomedical Corporation was approved by the FDA in 2013 for use in those 18 years and older who are at an increased risk of exposure. Manufactured by Seqirus, Audenz was FDA approved in 2020 and can be used in people six months and older for protection against H5N1. However, the U.S. has a small stockpile of H5N1 and H7N9 bird flu vaccines, so if an outbreak were to happen among humans, the amount of vaccines would not be enough to withstand the outbreak. There are concerns that once the disease mutates into new variants, old stockpiled vaccines may not be as effective. However, a 2019 study found H5N1 vaccines made in 2004 were still effective 12 years later. A separate study in 2017 found H5N1 vaccines made in 2004 and 2005 protected against the H5N2 virus in ferrets in 2014.

A 6-MONTH DELAY AFTER OUTBREAK?

&gt;The government plans to mass produce vaccines once an outbreak occurs, which can take at least six months to create enough for the entire population. A majority of the approved vaccines are created by incubating doses in chicken eggs, but the disease�s rate of fatality among poultry poses an issue for these vaccines. The makers of Audenz, the only non-egg-based FDA approved H5N1 vaccine, expect to have 150 million vaccines ready within six months of an announcement of a bird flu pandemic. However, as the New York Times pointed out, there are seven billion people in the world. This means only 2% of the world�s population will receive the Audenz vaccine within the first six months of a potential pandemic. Scientists and researchers are attempting to get mRNA-based influenza vaccines FDA approved, similar to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid vaccines, because mRNA vaccines take less time to produce.",2023-02-16 04:25:56,informative
"Phylogenetic analysis using Nextstrain ([https://nextstrain.org](https://nextstrain.org/), accessed: 1 Feb 2023 \[5\]) indicated that the I396M substitution, seldom observed in other H5N1 viruses, was acquired in an avian host immediately before emergence of the H5N1 virus in mink.

The analysis moreover showed that substitution S369I, which is at the position of a sialic acid contact residue in the 2SBS, was obtained immediately before the acquisition of I396M. Substitution of residues at positions 369 and 396 has been shown to negatively affect N1 activity \[3,4\], herein referred to as residues 372 and 400. A functional 2SBS promotes NA activity, presumably by bringing multivalent sialic acid substrates in closer proximity of the catalytic site.

A functional 2SBS, which specifically binds to alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid receptors, has been lost in all human (pandemic) viruses and in several other viruses adapted to mammalian host species.

Notably, whereas a 2SBS is conserved in nearly all avian IAVs \[3\], it is disrupted in some avian influenza A(H7N9) and A(H9N2) isolates. This preceded the acquisition of mutations in HA that decreased binding to avian-type alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid receptors. It is possible that this concerted evolution of NA and HA is driven by the need to preserve an optimal HA-NA balance.

At the same time, such compensatory mutations may also increase binding to human-type receptors \[3\], as was recently demonstrated for H5N1 viruses \[6\].Disruption of the 2SBS in H5N1 viruses in minks is thus far an unreported feature that they have in common with human-adapted influenza A viruses.

Loss of the 2SBS may drive selection for changes in the receptor binding properties of HA, possibly resulting in increased binding to human-type receptors. Such changes in HA are expected to promote replication and transmission in mammalian hosts, including humans. Preservation or loss of the 2SBS is likely a viral host range determinant and could be an early adaptation signal that should be included in analysis of the pandemic potential of emerging IAVs.

(To put this in simpler terms. This recent report suggests that some of the mutations found in the minks in the Spanish farm did not actually start in those minks. They were acquired first in an avian host before jumping to the minks. This is concerning because even if those minks were culled, these mutations may still be in the wild: (I396M) and (S369I). Also, the loss of a functioning 2SBS (something that happens in all human pandemic) was also seen in these mutations in the minks.

However, I don�t see in the report whether this loss of 2SBS also came from an avian host or not (even if it started in the minks, culling then wouldn�t stop it from being repeated in any other mammal). This comes after the first report by the Spanish scientists after the outbreak in the mink farm, who showed to the world that the variant had new mutations that could make the virus more transmissible between mammals and humans. I have a question for people who may be more informed in the topic than I am: does this report give any clue of whether the the amino acid substitution T271A in polymerase subunit PB2 reported also started in an avian host?)",2023-02-16 18:55:40,afraid

"I honestly don�t know enough about the science of vaccines to answer that! I mean, we�ve found with covid that, given the time it takes to develop a vaccine for a given strain, the virus can easily have moved on to new mutations by the time the vaccine is released, rendering the vaccine less effective than it really needs to be. We have the advantage with H5N1 that we have the infrastructure in place to start churning out vaccines pretty quickly once the virus data is available, but how/whether we can keep up with mutations I don�t know. I guess it depends on how contagious the strain is. Fewer people infected means less likelihood of mutations so more chance to keep up. So many unknowns!",2023-02-17 18:37:19,concerned
"Not an expert but been reading enough literature on vaccines, and what they would be like for a possible H5N1 pandemic.

There are a few antiviral medications that are currently being tested to see if the work against this particular virus. There�s four major therapeutics, so we�ll know what ones are effective at reducing viral replication.

Vaccination would be one way out of a H5N1 pandemic.

Any vaccine using traditional methods, that is egg based vaccine that�s an inactivated virus vaccine would take about six months to get the population of the United States vaccinated.

First they have to sample the virus, choose a candidate strain, then grow it, and manufacture it into useable doses. Growing is done in chicken eggs, and the U.S. government has a facility that is designed to be used in a pandemic just for eggs for vaccine production.

Roughly the best of those vaccines have a 60% protection against severe illness, and death. That�s on a good vaccine that matches the circulating strain. Some years they miss, but whatever virus that is sequenced going from human to human would be sequenced right away, and it�s genetics shared instantly, and put into production.

However we are absolutely in luck as we have just had a breakthrough with the research, and development of mRNA vaccines that means they�re an option on the table.

We�ve spent the past three years building up the manufacturing capacity of mRNA vaccines so an mRNA vaccine would be created, tested, and into arms in months to a year. The capacity to create millions of doses a month is there, they would just need to sequence the virus, create the particular mRNA, then wide scale manufacture it.

It would be another Operation Warp Speed.

There�s some incredible breakthroughs with vaccine technology you can read about such as a vaccine trialled that had all the 20 types of HA on flu viruses that was protective in mice, and ferrets.

Flu is a little bit more prone to mutations on the parts that infects cells than coronaviruses, but still there are conserved areas of the the virus, and because this vaccine would be targeting one virus

Moderna are currently running trials of how effective an mRNA vaccine for flu is. Their current trial showed effectiveness vs traditional against influenza A types H1N1 and H3N2. They�ll be releasing their results on efficacy in the coming weeks, which they say are promising. They didn�t have great results against influenza B types. But lucky for us, H5N1 HPAI is an Influenza A type.

"It is inevitable that there will be a next influenza pandemic in humanity's future. When it will occur and the identity of the culprit influenza strain are not fully answerable questions. There are myriad different avian influenza viruses constantly circulating, mutating, and regrouping in their natural waterfowl hosts.

As such, the prolific spreadopens in a new tab or window of the H5N1 influenza A virus in multiple avian species across the globe -- with spill into multiple mammalian species and a handful of human cases -- has prompted many to question whether an influenza pandemic caused by this virus is imminent. This is an important question that must be asked of all novel influenza viruses. However, the answers, when it comes to influenza, are not that simple and require placing this strain into a larger context of avian influenza more generally.

The Mechanics of Infection with Avian Influenza Viruses

There are multiple steps necessary for an avian influenza virus to cause a human influenza pandemic. The first step -- capacity to infect humans -- is not easily traversed as most avian influenza viruses are incapable of infecting humans. The virus must find the human host hospitable in order to productively infect it.

Humans and birds are distinct enough that most of the viruses that infect birds cannot infect humans. Of the numerous combinations of the 18 hemagglutinin (H) varieties and 11 (N) varieties that naturally circulate in birds, only a select group have been able to even infect humans. Additionally, even if an avian origin virus is capable of infecting the human, the human may just be a dead-end host who will not spread it any further. Indeed, this is what mostly happens: a rare human with close contact to avian species (such as a poultry farmer) may get infected but no further human cases occur. Although the severity of the infection may range from extremely mild to extremely severe, no human-to-human spread occurs.

Despite this being the usual course of events, the feared scenario is an avian virus possessing or evolving the requisite genetics to be able to productively infect a human and be able to go on and infect another human. Sustained human-to-human transmission is the harbinger of an influenza pandemic and, in 1918, this sequence of events catapulted a wholly avian-origin influenza virus into a devastating global pandemic.

Is H5N1 destined to follow the 1918 H1N1?

The Story of H5N1 Influenza Viruses

Medical News from Around the Web
First identified in birds in China in 1996opens in a new tab or window, H5N1 did not reveal its full threat potential until six fatal human cases occurred in a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. These cases prompted aggressive culling in the live poultry markets to extinguish the risk. The virus, nonetheless, did not disappear -- it continued to circulate in its wild avian reservoir -- and reappeared to cause human infections again in 2003. This second appearance led to extensive pandemic influenza planning in the U.S., including stockpiling of vaccines and antivirals. To date, over 800 humans have been infected with H5N1 with about half succumbing to infection.

The Clades of H5N1

An important aspect of characterizing the H5N1 threat is understanding that this strain of influenza A is not monolithic but composed of multiple different clades, or subtypes, which are in turn composed of sub-clades. The original human infections were caused by clade 0 of a high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) Asian lineage H5N1 influenza A virus. Human infections that have subsequently occurred have been with various clades and sub-clades. Each clade and sub-clade has different proclivities for infection, severity, and antiviral susceptibility. As such, not all H5N1 viruses have the same pandemic or severe human disease potential.

The H5N1 in headlines today is clade 2.3.4.4b. This clade is distinct from other H5N1 clades that have caused severe human infections in the past. This important fact, often missing from reporting, is crucial to consider when trying to gauge the threat that exists from this virus today.

Human and Other Mammalian Infections With 2.3.4.4b H5N1

Thus far in this outbreak there have been about a half dozenopens in a new tab or window human cases of H5N1. Most of these cases have been mild (the exception is one case in Ecuador of an H5, unknown N was severe), which may be an indication that this version of H5N1 is a significant departure from the more dangerous strains of H5N1. More significant is that there has been a striking rarity of infections (despite widespread exposure) compared to prior H5N1 outbreaks -- involving different clades -- where human cases were greater in numbers and more severe.

In contrast to the lack of human infections, the virus has been responsible for cases in multiple other mammalian speciesopens in a new tab or window ranging from bears to seals to minks. The latter, because of its close similarity to ferrets (the human influenza surrogate) has raised concerns about mammalian adaption, especially given a specific mutation in one of the genes (T271A in PB2). It remains unclear, however, whether mammals are able to spread the virus amongst each other or infection is occurring due to consumption of infected birds. Regardless, any mammalian infection potential must be taken seriously especially given the number of different mammals involved, each giving the virus more opportunity to further adapt.

Other Avian Influenza Viruses of Concern

While there is currently a lot of justified focus on H5N1, it is important to recognize that other avian influenza viruses have been and are infecting humans as well. Some of these strains are quite alarming. One such virus is H7N9opens in a new tab or window. This strain has been responsible for over 1,500 human cases occurring in six epidemic waves in China. Nearly 40% of those infected with H7N9 died. H5N6opens in a new tab or window is another avian influenza virus that merits close monitoring.

While each of these avian influenza viruses capable of infecting humans merit attention, determining which is most concerning is difficult. To help evaluate the relative risks of various avian influenza viruses on humans, the CDC developed an Influenza Rapid Assessment Toolopens in a new tab or window (IRAT) that assesses the pandemic potential of avian influenza viruses using 10 attributes. Attributes include receptor specificity, human infection potential, disease severity, and other variables. Using this criteria, H7N9 is rated as a moderate to high risk virus with the most impact, whereas all H5N1s including 2.3.4.4.b are rated as moderate, with lower emergence and impact compared to H7N9.

Preparations

Irrespective of where any given virus falls on the IRAT ranking, if it has some significant risk of causing human disease, several important actions should be undertaken. These include: development of pre-pandemic vaccine stock that can be used for vaccine production if the need arises; stockpiling of vaccines for the highest risk viruses; testing of antiviral susceptibility of various strains; and vigilant surveillance of influenza viruses in humans, birds, and swine (which were the animal species that sparked the last influenza pandemic in 2009). All of these activities are currently being performed by the U.S. to some extent, but additional resources can enhance resiliency. Additionally, it is important to recognize that the threat of influenza is greatly enhanced by the lack of a universal flu vaccine that is broadly protective against various strains of the virus. To truly take influenza off the table as a threat, a universal vaccine will be required.

Regardless of the ultimate trajectory of the H5N1 strain currently engulfing avian species globally, it serves as a reminder of the absolute necessity to be proactive in the face of an unavoidable future influenza pandemic.",2023-02-17 20:44:49,concerned
"Okay so let�s say worst case, H1N1 jumps to humans and has a long asymptomatic infectious period (this would be the worst case because w/ such a high fatality rate it would burn out very fast and not spread very far, making wack a mole / quarantine like options be viable)

The first week there would be confusion. The second week denial. The third week hospitals and morgues will begin filling up so fast that it would make the early days of Covid look like a nice vacation in Cabo. By the fourth week everyone on this rock will be collectively traumatized and terrified as the entire world essentially crawls to a halt. This misery would continue on for months as governments scramble to get shots in arms and quell civil unrest. If we�re lucky 20% who get sick die. If we�re unlucky as many as 60%

If it�s in the 20% range it will be terrifying and history will look back on it and shudder, especially since we�ll be able to document it all in detail thanks to the internet and our phones.

If it�s 60% then it�ll be biblical and society as a whole will not recover from it in our lifetimes. Humanity will still prevail but honestly you�ll need to fear more than the flu, it�ll be total civil unrest. Humanity isn�t capable of being able to quell the kind of fear and horror that would stem from such a situation. I hope to god it never happens as life has been pretty nice overall the past thirty years I�ve been alive. Even Covid was a breeze when compared to other historical atrocities of the past.

It won�t be comparable to the Spanish flu either, because of two important factors. Firstly the world is a very different place and pathogens are able to spread much quicker and faster than ever before thanks to ease of travel and sheer population size. The second factor is much scarier. Spanish Flu had a CFR of 2 - 3%. H5N1 in animal populations could be as high as 60%. You may think that it will fair different in humans but as of now roughly 800 people have contracted H5N1 from animals and of the 800, nearly 400 have perished. The CFR officially is 53% according to the WHO.",2023-02-17 21:18:25,afraid
"It�s complicated. A lot of it has to do with what the selective pressures are. Yellow fever for example spreads via mosquitoes, and this means that there is no selective pressure against more virulent strains. This is one reason why yellow fever has remained about as lethal as it was a long time ago. SARS-CoV-2 had a long latency at first, the pre symptomatic contagious period made people worry that it would retain its high mortality for a while. Viruses that spread from person to person with no latency (presymptomatic contagious periods) tend to be selected for lower lethality, and influenza has a very short latency, if any at all. This is primarily a result of people staying away from others during contagious periods because they feel sick. The strains that make people feel less sick are selected for as people are more likely to interact and spread them if they don�t feel so bad.

A much much larger player in mortality rates is the relative na�vet� (immunologically speaking) of the population. A totally naive population will experience much higher mortality from a novel pathogen. Even common cold viruses like rhinovirus can be lethal to populations never exposed to them, and this has occurred in newly contacted tribes. For CoVid, there has been a lot of debate as to whether the virus became less lethal or whether or not it�s just the increased immunity in populations exposed to it that has reduced its mortality. The recent spread through China should help to determine if this is the case.

To further complicate matters, some portion of every population will have intrinsic immunity to any given pathogen. They may lack the receptors that the pathogen binds to, or they may have the ideal MHC I (major histocompatibility complex type 1) subclasses for antigen presentation for specific diseases. These individuals can be selected for in a bad outbreak, though fortunately the modern era has fewer of these. There are interesting studies of regional MHC I clades that show how major disease outbreaks favored specific subtypes.

So, though there is not a specific rule that viruses evolve towards lower mortality, it is much more common as a result of; selective pressure, immunological adaptation on our part, and selection of less susceptible populations in extreme cases. Definitely not guaranteed, you�re right about that, but also much more likely than not. Especially in influenza, we�ve seen that occur several times. To illustrate that, consider the fact that most modern human influenza A strains have shared significant amounts of their genetics with the 1918 H1N1 flu, which had about a 3% mortality, current strains tent to hover around 0.05-0.1%.

With all that said, H5N1 would be a disaster if it jumped to human to human transmission. Even if it continued the trend of becoming less lethal over the course of a few years, that would mean a few years of dealing with a high mortality virus. Of course such a jump would almost certainly involve viral reassortment with a human influenza within a host infected by both H5N1 HPAI and a human influenza A, and this would probably dramatically reduce the mortality of the reassorted virus. A reassortment of this type would introduce antigens in to the new virus that were not novel to our immune system. No one knows by how much though, could be from 56% to 55% or 56% to 5% or lower. Who knows, both are scary anyways.

Just thought this biochemist should offer their views. Hope it clarifies and helps with understanding.",2023-02-17 22:20:43,concerned
"Currently, tamiflu works against H5N1. Also, there are a few approved vaccines for it, they�re just in short supply and not available. Ramping up production would take several months, about 6-9 to produce 150 million doses.

New mRNA technology may be able to produce more vaccines faster, and even an older less efficacious vaccine could provide significant protection against severe disease. Some virologists even speculate that current flu shots could confer some protection, though I�m skeptical of that myself.

Probably the best bet would be to wear a mask and stay in if possible like we all did in CoVid. Though influenza is spread via droplets, it�s r naught is lower than coronavirus. So, if you were able to avoid SARS-Cov-2 infection using those means you have a statistically better chance of avoiding this one. Also, flus tend to have a much shorter period of asymptomatic spread, so it�s less likely that a person will infect you on accident.

"Currently it only very rarely spreads human to human, and to my knowledge not any time recently. The few times that it did was between a caretaker and their close family. Of course there could be cases that occurred outside of scientific records.

The sialic acid receptors that H5N1 binds are very deep down in the lungs. Virus has to make it to them to infect and replicate. By contrast, human influenzas bind sialic acid receptors in the upper respiratory system very efficiently, and that is why they are much more contagious. This could change if H5N1 reassorts or mutates a lot, but such a mutation would
also decrease it�s fitness for its natural hosts (birds). This would mean that it would have to accumulate those mutations at the exact right time to enter a large pool of susceptible hosts, otherwise it would dead end in the bird population.

Thanks for your contribution to the thread. I've appreciated reading it. I was actually researching this earlier this evening when I came across this info on Tamiflu and decided to research any natural  neuraminidase inhibitors . Do you think those could be even remotely effective? IF Tamiflu was effective in treating H5N1 what does that even mean with a CFR of over 50%? How is effective defined? 25% CFR?,2023-02-17 22:48:32,skeptical
"It�s all very complicated, and to see if any specific inhibitor works requires a lot of testing. Furthermore, it�s always a risk that neuraminidase inhibitors can have off target effects, tamiflu does (it actually makes me very sick when I take it). So to say if one is safe would require a lot of scientific study.

To evaluate the efficacy a lot of different language is used. Prevention of severe disease, reduction of duration, prevention of infection, and so on. Each of them have very specific clinical meanings. This was a big sticking point with the covid vaccines, they prevent severe disease, not infection. Severe disease is defined as an ICU stay in this case (moderate disease for CoVid is a hospital admission and stay). Most people don�t feel like staying in the hospital is �moderate�. So, to say what tamiflu would do to the case fatality rates would be tough without a lot of studies. Since less that 1000 people have been tracked as having H5N1 it�s hard to study. Most of those were before tamiflu was approved for use, so they couldn�t evaluate it (there was a big outbreak in Northern Africa in the early 2000�s if I recall correctly).

Case fatality in general is flawed though. A recent study published on this Reddit group showed a 86% seropositivity in Javan poultry workers. Most of them had mild symptoms, none of them died, some never got sick at all. I wrote a long thread on it if you find it. Bottom line though, there could be hundreds or even thousands of mild cases that are not included in the current case fatality data. Most virologists that I�ve read that write about this assume that this is the case, but who knows for sure. If it is, then the case fatality would be a lot lower, still scary, and probably much much higher than SARS-CoV-2 (which was 1-2%).

Something US and Western hospitals were seemingly unable to plan for themselves.  Something that all governments failed as well.  So sometimes laypersons get it right and �experts� don�t.

"It's interesting that you lay it out like this- I feel that I was in the same boat wrt Covid- I had already stocked up on some canned goods, water, masks etc. well before the lockdowns, but I am currently quite concerned about H5N1. We're not in December 2019 territory yet but I am concerned. Not trolling, but why are you not concerned?",2023-02-18 13:24:57,informative
"I think that this is probably true. Dr. Osterholm, a real expert on this specific virus, recently said anyone trying to predict what will happen with H5N1 is in for a big disappointment. That said he hedged by saying a human jump is definitely possible. With this in mind, there are other pandemic potentials that have already made the jump to human transmission that could be just as bad, like nippah virus, MERS, and others SARS like sarbeco viruses. I think the potential for H5N1 to be devastating if it jumped is very high, but that shouldn�t distract from other threats in the short term.

If you look at the mutations required for effective transmission in humans then it seems like H5N1 HPAI has a ways to go, unless it reassorts with a human influenza A. If that happens it would likely be a lot less lethal, though still quite dangerous. The best opportunity for this has historically been in swine, so watch that space (2009 occurred like that, and it�s speculated that 1918 did as well, both involved avian influenza A strains).

The way I see it is that a minuscule threat of complete devastation still merits appropriate precautions. I�m still stocking up, and whether it�s influenza, a new sarbeco (SARS Beta Coronavirus), or some as of yet discovered pathogen these precautions will pay off. For that matter they will also help in the case of other disasters. If there�s a major flood for instance, having extra food and sanitary supplies to prevent things like staph or other common infections is good.

Trying to provide a timeline to this would be very tough and basically a guess, even from an expert. The mink mutation to the polymerase is concerning, as are tamiflu resilience mutations observed in Vietnamese infection cases. That doesn�t mean it�s likely that it will continue that trend as these mutations also reduced fitness in the natural vector. Furthermore, the widespread distribution of H5N1 all but ensures that the genetic profiles vary significantly. The mutations observed in one local are not necessarily likely to be seen elsewhere. The polymerase mutation confers fitness in mammals but reduces it in avian species, the tamiflu resistance was correlated with reduced replication in humans. It�s a probability game with lots and lots of moving parts. The biggest step this virus took in potentiating a human jump was its jump to wild fowl a few years ago, this offers a wild vector outside of the control of humans. This makes it way tougher to stop, and with enough time comes more opportunities to coinfect some unlucky pig that already caught human influenza A from a handler. To become a pandemic, that reassorted virus would have to evade detection and culling efforts long enough to infect a pool of hosts and spread. The severity of the symptoms associated with H5N1 makes this less likely since really sick pigs and humans tend to go noticed, and that would hopefully lead to efforts to quarantine the affected individuals. It could happen though, it�s just got a lot of barriers to do so.",2023-02-18 14:16:56,concerned

"Thank you for this reasoned and informed response. I'm a former journalist without a science background, but I had very substantial preparations in place by the time COVID lockdowns started--and I am not a prepper by nature. Sometimes careful observation is all you need.

I see four kinds of preparation as helpful under the current circumstances:

1. Extend critical supplies (medication, dry goods on hand, etc.), but only a bit. My plan is to ensure we have an extra month of rice/beans/etc. on hand, in the event they are needed. Same with PPE. At this point, we're no longer keeping the kind of stores we did during pre-vaccine COVID, so this is just an adjustment back to the ""new normal"" in which bad things, like pandemics and super-storms, happen more often. And preparation helps.
2. Consume more news about the spread of H5N1 with a watchful and critical eye. For my part, I've come back onto Reddit explicitly for this purpose. I like Reddit but it ends up being a time suck for me, but it was extremely helpful in understanding that the world was, in fact, ending in early 2020. It's a good place to see news from all kinds of sources along with debate about what that news means. If I had just followed mainstream media, we would have had a much harder time in lockdown.
3. Plan on lacking access to eggs. There are alternatives to eggs in lots of dishes: aquafaba for mayo, flax or chia for baking, besan or tofu for scrambling or omelettes. Eggs are passing out of affordability for our home, and mayo already has. Having some recipes on hand that you've already tried and like is helpful. Also, chickpeas (for aquafaba), besan, and flax are all pretty shelf stable, unlike eggs, so they're good preps anyway. Also, buy them now before everybody else figures it out. In other words: imagine if you knew how to bake sourdough before March 2020, and you already have starter you use.
4. Come up with a plan on how you'll respond to the latest news, an if-then-else guide to help you make decisions when the time comes.

What isn't helpful for preparing and acting are predictions. The real value in this subreddit, for me, lies in being able to follow the latest news on H5N1. See Point 4, above. This is how I made decisions during COVID: setting up kind of mental ""circuit breakers"" that would trigger more or different prep/actions, and those breakers were flipped by news articles. Was it in Europe? Was it in large North American cities? What were Italian doctors saying (in Italian, not moderated by English-speaking press)? We looked at all kinds of things, set benchmarks for when we'd have to act, and then just acted. No thinking, no second-guessing, which can be very debilitating in the moment. ""It's now in Toronto, so time to get two more months of food."" So we buy more food. ""It's now in local hospitals, so we stop going out as we discussed."" It also concentrates preparation into one serious brainstorming session at a time when the world doesn't seem to be ending, which is huge. I'd say we were under far less stress on, say, March 15, 2020, than virtually everyone we knew. We had already gone through that stress and grief in our own time and pace. In other words, it's far easier to plan for a devastating H5N1 pandemic now than in the middle of one.

I think the only thing I'd adjust in terms of H5N1 is how quickly I respond to news of human-to-human spread. Given the r0 among birds, I think we'd be playing it super safe until hard data became available.",2023-02-18 16:07:38,informative

"Only one thing is completely certain and you all know this:

There will be a human flu pandemic in the near future. H5N1 is a pandemic (almost exclusively birds) right now.
Will the next Flu pandemic have a 50%+/- CFR? Not sure, but the way it�s effecting birds we need to take it seriously
*CFR= Case Fatality Rate

The thing we have control over is how we react to it as individuals and as a society. Humans have poor long-term planning capabilities as a species. We have a tendency to �live in the now� a strategy that worked great for our hunter gatherer ancestors that lived hand to mouth, in daily peril.

I have always liked the saying � fail to plan, plan to fail� military strategists have known the value of this for centuries. Applied to the potential of a biblical pandemic Flu, we all can see the value in a solid plan. Here is my strategy for a Pandemic Flu with a CFR of 10% or more:

3 month minimum supply of food for everyone in my safe circle (for my group this would be 10 people and a couple pets)
N-100 masks/goggles/face shields
All basic needs for minimum 3 months (water, shelter, heat etc)
Essential medications
Gear ( clothing, sleeping bags, matches, sharp axe etc)
Firearms and ammunition (civil unrest would be very likely and the ability to defend yourself without help is important)

"&gt;Still, scientists are always watching for the virus to find situations that would encourage those adaptations. For instance: Spanish and Italian scientists disclosed last month that in October 2022, an H5N1 variant infected minks on a fur farm in northwest Spain. The virus might have been passed to a single mink by a wild bird, or via chicken carcasses used for feed. But once on the farm, it made minute adaptations that allowed it to spread from one mink to another. To stop the outbreak, all the farm�s minks�almost 52,000�were killed.

&gt;That outbreak was unnerving, twice over. Not only had the virus begun adapting to mammals, but to a particular mammal that might have direct relevance for people. Minks belong to the same family as ferrets, which are already used by scientists for flu research because they develop symptoms in the same progression that humans do.

&gt;But there�s a third reason why the mink outbreak was notable, something that is so normal in animal agriculture that it mostly goes unnoticed. The Spanish farm was not a property where minks gamboled freely while they grew their fur. Instead, it was an intensive farm where the animals were confined in cages. Most of the poultry farms affected in the US have been intensive confinement farms also, though what that means differs by bird species: large metal barns for broilers, barns and sometimes interior cages for layers, and mesh-curtained sheds for turkeys.

&gt;Operating in confinement doesn�t necessarily make a farm more vulnerable to infection, but once a virus penetrates the premises, confinement ensures that very many animals are exposed at once. That puts a lot of animals at risk�some of the egg farms wiped out by flu last year lost more than 5 million birds�and it also gives the virus a plethora of hosts to mutate in. This drives people outside the poultry industry to suggest that if very large farms pose a risk of amplifying a virus, maybe making them smaller should be part of viral defense.

&gt;�When there�s public discussion of addressing zoonotic disease, it almost immediately turns to vaccination, preparedness, biosecurity�but no one discusses addressing the root cause,� says Jan Dutkiewicz, a political economist and visiting fellow at Harvard Law School�s Brooks McCormick Jr. Animal Law and Policy Clinic. �We would never have a debate about preventing cancer from tobacco products without talking about stopping smoking. Yet when it comes to zoonotic disease risk, there is a huge reticence to discuss curbing animal production.�

&gt;That might be an unthinkable proposal, given that Americans ate an estimated 1.45 billion wings during the Superbowl last Sunday�and that as a culture, we�re not inclined to ask many questions about how our food arrives at our plates. �Industrial animal production operates and maybe even depends on a distance between the consumer and the realities and violence of industrial animal production,� says Adam Sheingate, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University who studies food and agriculture policy. �Most people really prefer not to know how their food is produced.� Still, he points out, when disease risks from food become clear, other nations respond rapidly�such as when the UK changed cattle-farming practices after Creutzfeldt�Jakob disease, the human variant of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or �mad cow disease,� killed 178 people in the mid-1990s.

&gt;�This is not to say we get rid of poultry,� says Andrew deCoriolis, executive director of Farm Forward, a nonprofit that works to improve farm animal welfare. �It's to say: **We have to understand what are the factors that are the biggest risk drivers, and perhaps legislate changes to them. That could be moving farms out of flyways, it could be reducing the number of barns on a particular location, it could be reducing animal density within the barns.�**

&gt;Dreadful though it is, it�s possible to construe the current outbreak as an opportunity to begin gathering big data about what makes poultry production so vulnerable. Precisely because the disease has spread so widely, data could reveal patterns that haven�t been visible before�whether affected farms use certain feed or water systems, for instance, or buy just-hatched birds from specific breeding lines, or are sited in particular landscape features or lie under the migration routes of identifiable birds. �There isn't a lot of research to show what are absolute best practices, because viruses are stochastic�you don't know exactly when you're going to get an introduction,� says Meghan Davis, a veterinarian and epidemiologist and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.",2023-02-19 00:50:56,concerned

"I think the supposed reported mortality rate of 50% would definitely make people panic and worry and try to do anything they can to make themselves safe.

On the other hand, not meaning to sound dismissive and or ignorant, but at the same time, there are probably a lot more asymptomatic/mild cases of H5N1 than the mortality rate being reported, so maybe the mortality rate is much lower than initially thought.

This would be especially elevated if it is reported that kids are dying.

As parents, many people would do anything to protect their child from harm, and when it infects kids and takes their lives, people will take this absolutely seriously. Parents who lose kids to H5N1 would be adamant that they come up with a vaccine and to do anything they can to prevent this from happening to another parent.

There would definitely be pressure from amongst the international community to try and come up with an mRNA vaccine for this in a shorter time frame than for COVID.

Many people who lost loved ones during the COVID pandemic or who are long term sufferers of long haul COVID would be hyper vigilant, as are those with compromised immune systems.

"The mortality of the virus in minks and humans cannot be compared. Although their respiratory systems are very similar to ours, each species has its own susceptibility to infectious diseases.

H5N1 killed about one in two people infected so far. This is huge. But the number of human cases diagnosed to date is very small. So we can't have a real idea of the actual mortality rate. And that depends on many factors: age, co-morbidities, genetic factors, probably also the amount of viral exposure during infection. It is indeed possible that some humans were infected by the virus without realizing it, either because they were totally asymptomatic (there seems to have been some cases reported in exposed workers, but there is a debate in the scientific community between real infection by the virus and a PCR positivity related only to the presence of the virus in the mucous membranes of the nose, without the virus having replicated and infected cells). Some may also have had such mild symptoms that they were not tested either. In human cases from other subtypes of bird flu, some only had a conjunctivitis after being infected. So why not?

But. While the total number of human H5N1 infections to date is probably underestimated, I doubt it is by much. This is for two reasons:

� Workers in contact with potentially infected poultry are routinely tested for antibodies when an avian flu outbreak occurs on a farm. The positivity rate is usually very low, which means that very few workers have been in real contact with the virus. Which I remind you is very difficult to transmit to humans, even in case of risky contact and they are daily throughout the world.

� The virus is still very avian adapted, when it infects a human the receptors that the virus will mainly use to reproduce are those found deep in the respiratory tract, in the lungs. This is part of the reason why the virus is not easily transmissible from one human to another, unlike Covid which binds more to receptors in the upper airways. And it is also why H5N1 causes severe symptoms, resulting in pneumonia, respiratory distress and in the most severe cases multiple organ failure � so the diagnosis is easily suspected if the risk factors (e.g. handling of dead birds) are met. This probably reduces the likelihood of having many cases that fly under the radar.

So to conclude, I would say: yes, it is possible to miss asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. But there can't be many of them. The real mortality rate should probably remain dangerously high. The question is: Will the virus lose lethality if it mutates to transmit efficiently between humans? Maybe it will, maybe it won't.",2023-02-21 12:37:25,concerned

Unfortunately, it has mostly been fear mongering and panic posts (this is not intended as an attack on you) which leads to more panic and becomes a feedback loop, making it *seem* like the pandemic is going to start tomorrow. The reality is that, in it's current form, H5N1 is a **lower respiratory flu** in humans, which is what makes it so incredibly dangerous. BUT, and here's the good news, that is also **why it is so incredibly difficult for human to human transmission** (upper respiratory flu is what spreads easily). Upper respiratory flus are far less dangerous, but spread easily. So in order for this to become widespread with human to human transmission, something fundamental would have to mutate about the virus which would most likely kick it into an upper respiratory flu. That would *significantly* decrease the severity and mortality rate. Could it still be bad? Sure, but nowhere near the ""1 out of every 2 people will die this year"" type of scenario. Avoid the panic posts because it's mostly people reading the headlines and running with that. I am far more concerned with the long-term environmental impacts of this given the loss of bird biodiversity and what that will mean for the animals and plants that depend on them (or are eaten by them).

"I really enjoyed reading this and I agree with everything you have to say. I would add to it that some of the current mortality rate may be skewed as a result of the medical systems present in the regions where these individuals were infected. That probably wouldn�t affect it a whole lot though, this is clearly a very dangerous virus if it�s able to infect and replicate.

The Javan poultry worker seropositivity study I saw that showed over 80% among workers definitely threw me for a loop. With that said, these workers could have also had a long term low level exposure to viral antigens that enabled them to build up a robust adaptive response without ever having an acute infection. The study did not detail what the balance of IgM to IgG was, so it�s tough to know what the timeline was. Also I agree wholeheartedly that PCR positivity is not the same as an infection. This has been troublesome in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, especially when some of the PCR evaluations use ridiculous cycle numbers.

On the issue of reduced mortality if this virus becomes more adapted to humans I have some thoughts. If this occurs as a result of host coinfection with human influenza A, which seems like the most likely route, then there�s a chance that the virus would bear epitopes that are not entirely novel to the human population. If that is the case then it seems like it would become a lower mortality virus than the extant H5N1 currently circulating. By how much is the big question. Even a reduction down to 5% would make it almost twice as deadly as the 1918 flu, and five times deadlier than SARS-CoV-2. Of course the propensity of these types of viruses to initiate deadly cytokine positive feedback cycles could also mean that such epitopes only further encourage immune dysfunction. I tend to err on the side of thinking that having familiar epitopes is good, but the immune system is complicated in these respects. Also, there�s always a chance that emergent viruses contain super antigens, and there are those that believe 1918 could have involved such a case, and that the CoVid multi system inflammatory disease seen in children is caused by them as well (this is still being studied).

If instead the virus were to mutate without reassortment with a human influenza then it seems like all bets are off. It could even become more deadly, though history tells us that it�s likely to stay the same or decrease a little bit. Over time it would become less deadly as the population becomes less naive, and the short or even absent latency seen in influenza would hopefully help to select for less virulence over time. However, with all that said, it would be a disastrous couple of years that would almost certainly change the world in a lot of ways. Hopefully we never find out.

Does this mean that there may be some form of herd immunity occurring in the sea lions/mammals? Or could it mean something else?",2023-02-22 17:49:49,concerned
"We don't know for sure. The suspicion is that it is spreading between sea lions or has mutated in a way that allows it to more easily infect mammals, but that has not been proven. As a rule, researchers don't declare things that haven't been proven. So right now it's just a ""serious concern.""

&gt; Such high levels of mortality in a social animal are worrisome. We cannot exclude direct transmission among sea lions due to their colonial breeding, and because many animals died simultaneously in groups. In fact, based on recent research suggesting the first mammal-to-mammal infection in minks (Neovison vison) (9) and the large number of sea lions currently affected, we cannot rule out that the virus has adapted to mammals and that sea lion-sea lion transmission has begun in Peru; this should be urgently investigated. Moreover, the mass mortality of animals that can weigh around 350 kg (10) produces an enormous biomass of infected tissue, which could perpetuate the transmission of H5N1 and other pathogens. This could have serious consequences for the ecosystem and human health.

&gt; Further research is required to address the transmission pathway in social mammals. This is particularly important in our case, given the complexities of the H5N1 Peruvian outbreak; i.e., severe mortality of wild birds, potential wild bird spillover to mammals, dead animals on beaches with human presence and human interaction with infected animals (see Supplementary Material Video 1). Since the emergence of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (Gs/Gd) H5N1 influenza A virus in China in 1996, different Highly Pathogenic Influenza Viruses (HPIV) have produced thousands of human infections with a lethality of 50% (3,11). We would like to call attention to the fact that in this geographical region of the world, human�infected animal interaction is common, so infections might begin to rise (there is already one case of a 9-year-old girl in Ecuador; https://www.eldiario.com.ar/242825-se-confirmo-el-primer-caso-de-gripe-aviar-en-nina-de-9-anos-en-ecuador/) and this must be addressed if we are to avoid the risk of a pandemic through evolutionary emergence (12).

"So I think it�s important to realize that there are a ton of different ways to measure and report how deadly an illness is. The general public tends to throw around words like �mortality rate� and �fatality rate� and more, but in epidemiology these words mean specific things, and they can�t be interchanged.

For instance, mortality rate refers to the frequency of death from a specific disease over a specific period of time. Usually this is reported as deaths per one thousand (or one hundred thousand) people in a year. For H5N1, the mortality rate in humans is very, very low, since less than a thousand humans have ever been documented as with it since its discovery in the 90s. Per year, basically zero people die from H5N1 when you use this measure, because H5N1 is very rare in humans. Less than one in one hundred thousand people die per year of H5N1.

The other figure for mortality you�re likely to see a lot is the case fatality rate. This is the percentage of people who get infected with a disease that die from that disease. It isn�t time limited like mortality rate. So for H5N1, the case fatality rate is estimated at 56 percent, since just over half of the confirmed cases have died. Case fatality rates can be tricky for rare diseases, though, because asymptomatic and mild cases are often missed.

So the key thing is to realize that you can�t use the case fatality rate of 56 percent and apply it to the hundred thousand sea lion population in Peru. First, that number is a case fatality rate, so it�s saying (about) half of infected people die. So if one hundred thousand are infected, fifty thousand die. If ten are infected, five die. But we have no idea how many sea lions have been infected. It might have been just those 700 or so and they all died. It might be that all hundred thousand have been infected snd only the 700 died. We don�t know. And second, that 56 percent figure is from *human* infections, not sea lion infections. We don�t know the case fatality rate for sea lions, but it�s likely different than that of humans. We do know that the case fatality rate is different (higher) for birds, for instance. It�s likely to be different for every species.

Since you seem pretty interested in this topic, I�d recommend trying to find some free videos or lessons on basic epidemiology. I think that�ll help you understand what�s going on a bit better and maybe offer some reassurance.",2023-02-23 10:31:28,concerned
The difference with covid 19 is that H5N1 is everywhere. We don't know where the mutation will come from. Is it possible that we have multiple mutation in the same time  all over the word like the bamboes flowering ?,2023-02-23 12:29:54,skeptical
"A lot of the early SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were using 30 cycles or more. Especially in England and other parts of Europe (source on that is the virology podcast TWIV, several episodes from 2020-2022 covered this problem, and they cite dozens of papers so singling any of them out is tough without going back through, I�ve provided links to an episode and their archive below). So, while a positive PCR test confirms viral presence, and typically infection, diagnosing CoVid based on that positive result is not always accurate. It probably would be if they used fewer cycles though, and to be fair most testing centers are doing so at present. The antigen tests tend to have a better correlation between positive results and actual illness from SARS-CoV-2, though they also have a higher rate of false negatives.

As related to H5N1, I believe the initial commenter had concerns that this conflation could occur again, which would skew the data on mortality. Maybe they�ll chime in if so. It goes without saying that viral RNA collected in the nostril and properly primed and amplified using rtPCR doesn�t necessarily correlate to replication of H5N1 since it has to access sialic acid receptors that are only found in the lower respiratory system (at least for now, hopefully that doesn�t change). Instead it could just be from virus that became trapped in the mucosa of the nostril or pharynx, in this case PCR would only confirm the presence of virus and possibly not infection at all. SARS-CoV-2 is different since the ACE2 receptor is found on a large cross section of epithelial cells, and this enables replication in the nostrils and pharynx.

But you�re definitely correct, I wasn�t being as careful with the terminology as I should�ve been. I apologize for the inaccuracy, and appreciate your response drawing attention to it. The distinction I should have made was between viral infection and viral infection related disease. Colloquially, most people equate infection with disease, and as I�m sure you know, this is often not true when it comes to viral infections (as in many cases of the HPV family of viruses, many cases of Hepatitis C, asymptomatic or sub clinical SARS-CoV-2, and so on).

What type of research do you do? I�m involved in cancer research myself, and only dabble in virology out of interest.

Here�s a TWIV podcast link to at least one episode that discusses the PCR positivity issue, there are a number of other ones, not sure if this is the best example as I don�t have the time to listen to it again at the moment. [TWIV](https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-638/)

"I love reading about Virues/Molecular Biology/ Evolutionary Biology as a hobby and intellectual interest.  I do not practice as a Scientist.
With that said:
Yes. H1N5 has been around a long time.
Does it jump into Humans?
Yes - very rarely. And into folks who work directly with poultry, and come into direct/repeated contact. It can happen, but it takes brute force - so to speak.
Is it deadly to humans?
CFR is about 50% in the cases where humans get H5N1.
Does it jump into other mammals?
Yes. It is rare (I should say \*was\*), and again typically from direct contact such as an animal that eats an infected bird. It would come up now and again in a wild fox, etc.
Are there any known mammal-to-mammal transmission of avian H5N1?
Not that I know of today.


Looking forward:
There are other strains of HxNx viruses. H5N6 and H3N8 which have been developing better ability to jump to mammal species. One virus has proven to be 30% better at infecting mammalian tissue (both in vitro - in a petri dish, and in vivo - in a population of guinea pigs in a lab).
Those strains are becoming more dominant in the wild bird population with some countries now reporting one or the other as the dominant strain in their bird populations. But in the meantime, H5N1 is also co-mingling with these viruses. So what we see happening in countries like Poland (cats) and Chili (seals, dolphin etc) is that it appears to be infecting mammals at a much higher rate, with some speculation in chili that rate of infection is so high within the population there is speculation that is may be jumping mammal-to-mammal (speculation! no proof!!! It is just because the % infected in a population is quite high). In other words - the H5N1 may have adopted some of the mutations present on the other HxNx viruses and has developed the molecular components to adapt  to life among mammalian cells (think of the ""spike"" that COVID had to grab onto a human cell).


Before you panic:
\- we have Tamiflu which works on avian flus (in fact this was the Obama/Biden pandemic plan, in preparation for an avian flu and Tamiful has been stockpiled). When COVID arrived, there were no known anti-virals. So the best thing was to avoid it.
\- the theory (but we won't know until it actually happens) the theory is that when it does become human-to-human transmissible, that it will be less deadly. Much like SARS virus - the first few outbreaks into human showed 10% (SARS 2003) and 30% (MERS) mortality - but still no human-to-human infection. When it finally did make the leap to human transmission, it was deadly!!! but just not 30% deadly. (thank goodness). I am hoping that will be the same with this. But WE DON'T KNOW!!!! I have already seen videos of folks telling making these grand predictions that it won't have a high CFR once human-to-human infectious.  Plain truth - we don't know and we will NEVER KNOW  until this happens, and Science has a chance to collect and analyze the data. Until then - ignore them, as they are ass hats.  If this takes off as human to human- I will be the person quietly sitting at home, avoiding contact with other people, protecting my 86 yo Mother.

There are many possible outcomes to an H5N1 Pandemic in the modern era. The worst case scenario is in my opinion less likely than something moderate. A human strain of H5N1 would likely be much easier to slow down than COVID 19 was. We can distribute a vaccine much more quickly. The virus itself is unlikely to have as high of an R0 spread factor as COVID 19. COVID 19 had a very high R0 factor. There are antiviral medications which are likely to be at least somewhat effective to treating H5N1.

"In the current outbreak if H5N1 the current public health risk is low. H5N1 has killed millions of birds and continues to occasionally cause our breaks in other animals such as cows. There cases in humans have not been widespread and small outbreaks have occurred since the early 2000s. In the 2024 recent outbreak, most of the few cases of transmission to humans have occurred among famers/dairy workers.

The good news for right now is that unlike the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been no evidence of person to person transmission.The possibility of an H5N1 pandemic has been monitored since the first recorded case appeared in humans in 1997.

But to answer your real question a pandemic is certainly a possibility. It has been recognized as a threat for almost 20 years. H1N1 has demonstrated it is able to infect humans. The real concern will exist if a strain of H5N1 develops that is able to effectively transmit from person to person and cause severe illness.

Right now as I've said the risk is low but in the coming decades who knows. The outbreak in cows is a relatively new development for the bird flu virus, and they are an unexpected host of the virus. This shows the virus is capable of adaptation. It may only be a matter of time before it can spread to humans. How transmission it is, as well as the populations level of immunity, would determine whether it becomes a pandemic or a small outbreak.

Some more good news is that unlike COVID-19, if this happens we should be much better prepared, we are already working on vaccines for bird flu, and are health authorized are closely monitoring and testing animal populations for the virus.

It's almost inevitable for another pandemic to happen in the future, we certainly will have another one at some point and we need to be prepared for that as a planet.

"A couple things to consider.

Ebola isn't transmitted nearly as easily, that is body fluids are required. We're talking about respiratory transmission with H5N1. That's always been the concern with avian influenza, it's the perfect recipe for disaster (potentially catastrophic) if it were to mutate for human-to-human transmission.

The case fatality rate (CFR) may decrease upon entering human-to-human transmission, estimates mentioned elsewhere in this thread are 14-33% when accounting for asymptomatic cases. Now, keep in mind, this never stopped H1N1 (1918) which had a CFR of very roughly &gt;2.5-5%, and was historically speaking one of the worst pandemics in history, whereas Covid is (again very roughly) 0.05-0.5% (this is complicated by the fact that not all infections were counted in both cases, but in the case of Covid we had relatively widespread testing).

You're correct that part of what helps Covid spread so rapidly (other than its relatively lower virulence on average and other factors) is its incubation period (the time it takes for you to start showing symptoms following exposure, during which you can be actively contagious).

The trouble is, the 1918 flu indeed had a similar incubation period to H5N1 (\~2-7d) which isn't that far off from Covid either (\~5-6d up to 11.5d in 97.5% of people). So, it's not really hard at all to imagine a highly virulent, contagious virus (particularly avian influenza which is and has been a huge concern for epidemiologists for a long time) with a long enough incubation period to replicate what we've seen with Covid but much, much worse.",2024-04-02 05:41:41,concerned
"Thanks for informing me, I really appreciate it.

I forgot that Ebola is primarily transmitted through substances not usually easily encountered decreased it's potential to spread, not just the CFR.

I see now that if the fatality rate decreases upon human - to - human transmission and the incubation period is closer to the incubation period of Covid and H1N1 in addition to having asymptomatic cases, H5N1 would indeed have the potential to become widespread very rapidly and potentially even worse than Covid as well. Which is a chilling thought, really hope it does not end up happening.",2024-04-02 06:29:42,informative
"It�s been a while but the first papers for Covid estimated I think maybe 3.5 percent mortality.  At the time the scale of asymptomatic transmission wasn�t known; asymptomatic cases meant the actual CFR was much less.  The estimates were off by a bit less than an order of magnitude.

H5N1 CFR is currently ~60%.  Some point out that there are likely missed cases, mild cases, intentionally hidden cases, etc, which should mean that the true CFR is lower.  But it�s unlikely to be two orders of magnitude lower, which is what would be needed to bring the current H5N1 strain down to the same universe as COVID CFR.

Influenza is respiratory infection spread through aerosols.  Historically, when a strain of jt becomes pandemic, it spreads quite efficiently and sustained human to human transmission is essentially impossible to fully stop until the pandemic runs its course or widely deployed vaccines enter the picture.

"That paper is a sobering read. The Abstract:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Background:** Accurate estimation of the case-fatality (CF) rate, or the proportion of cases that die, is central to pandemic planning. While estimates of CF rates for past influenza pandemics have ranged from about 0.1% (1957 and 1968 pandemics) to 2.5% (1918 pandemic), the official World Health Organization estimate for the current outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza to date is around 60%.


&gt;
&gt;**Methods and results:** The official estimate of the H5N1 CF rate has been described by some as an over-estimate, with little relevance to the rate that would be encountered under pandemic conditions. The reasons for such opinions are typically: (i) numerous undetected asymptomatic/mild cases, (ii) under-reporting of cases by some countries for economic or other reasons, and (iii) an expected decrease in virulence if and when the virus becomes widely transmitted in humans. Neither current data nor current literature, however, adequately supports these scenarios. While the real H5N1 CF rate could be lower than the current estimate of 60%, it is unlikely that it will be at the 0.1�0.4% level currently embraced by many pandemic plans. We suggest that, based on surveillance and seroprevalence studies conducted in several countries, the real H5N1 CF rate should be closer to 14�33%.


&gt;
&gt;**Conclusions**: Clearly, if such a CF rate were to be sustained in a pandemic, H5N1 would present a truly dreadful scenario. A concerted and dedicated effort by the international community to avert a pandemic through combating avian influenza in animals and humans in affected countries needs to be a global priority.",2024-04-03 16:58:38,afraid

Recent reports suggest that the largest global bird flu outbreak in history continues into 2023. A timely announcement by the WHO described a 56% fatality rate on humans infected by the H5N1 virus. According to the FAO, we bred 119 billion chickens last year alone.

This study, titled: *Alarming situation of emerging H5 and H7 avian influenza and effective control strategies*, also explains the origin of the viruses causing the current pandemic. But there is an even more interesting point.

An excerpt from this study in question:

&gt;Epidemiology studies have shown that humans become infected mainly through exposure to virus-infected poultry or a contaminated environment ; human-to-human transmission has been very limited. Therefore, before the H5 and H7 viruses acquire the ability to transmit from human to human, control of these viruses in animals is essential and effective to prevent them from infecting humans.

Here is more information, sourced. By u/Plant__Eater:

Perhaps the biggest risk of disease concerning livestock and poultry is influenza A - the only influenza virus known to cause pandemics.\[9\] It is hypothesized that every influenza virus that causes pandemics in humans is derived from avian influenza in aquatic birds.\[10\] Normally this wouldn't be an issue for us. The infected wild birds usually don't get sick, and the virus doesn't easily spread amongst humans.\[11\] But industrialized animal agriculture has changed that. One scientific review writes:

&gt;Hosts such as swine and gallinaceous poultry that are favorable for transmission and efficient replication of both zoonotic and human viruses can serve as mixing vessels and pose the greatest risk for the development of novel reassortments that can replicate competently in humans.\[12\]

In other words, livestock and poultry are great at making it easier for viruses to spread amongst humans. As to why this is, one author explains:

&gt;...virtually every effort to further industrialize broiler \[chicken\] biology has resulted in the emergence of new risks and vulnerabilities. Intensive confinement combined with increased genetic uniformity has created new opportunities for the spread of pathogens. Increased breast-meat yield has come at the expense of increased immunodeficiency.\[13\]

It is likely that animal agriculture enabled the 1957 Asian Flu, 1968 Hong Kong Flu,\[14\] bird flu,\[15\] and the 2009 swine flu.\[16\] Of these, bird flu is the cause for most concern. In past outbreaks, the case-fatality (CF) rate was 60 percent, although one study suggests that if it became a larger pandemic, it would have a median CF rate of approximately 23.5 percent.\[17\] It is thought that the 1918 Spanish Flu may have infected one-third of the global population and had a CF rate of 2.5 percent.\[18\] If bird flu were to mutate in such a way that it was anywhere near as contagious as Spanish Flu, with a CF rate almost 10 times higher than Spanish Flu, the results would be apocalyptic.

&gt;We can't scare people enough about H5N1 \[bird flu\].\[19\]",2023-01-15 10:07:12,concerned

"Excerpt from the linked summary^1 by Angela Nelson:

&gt;Researchers at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University found that an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was associated with the deaths of more than 330 New England harbor and gray seals along the North Atlantic coast in June and July 2022, and the outbreak was connected to a wave of avian influenza in birds in the region.

&gt;HPAI is more commonly known as bird flu, and the H5N1 strain has been responsible for about 60 million poultry deaths in the U.S. since October 2020, with similar numbers in Europe.

&gt;The virus was known to have spilled over from birds into mammals, such as mink, foxes, skunk, and bears, but those were mostly small, localized events.

&gt;This study is among the first to directly connect HPAI to a larger scale mortality event in wild mammals.

&gt;The accepted knowledge is that H5N1 is nearly 100% fatal for domestic and wild birds other than waterfowl, and the same is proving true when it comes to spillover in wild mammals.

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;All the seals that tested positive for HPAI were deceased at the time of sampling or succumbed shortly after.

&gt;None of the animals that tested positive recovered. However, it�s possible some asymptomatic or recovered cases never came into the stranding networks.

&gt;In addition to the seal mortality event in New England, which was the first time H5N1 was detected in marine mammals in the wild, other locations have lost marine mammals to the virus.

&gt;Peru announced about 3,500 sea lions died from the virus, Canada reported a seal mortality event along the St. Lawrence Estuary, and there was a similar event with seals in the Caspian Sea, according to news reports from Russia.

&gt;A hotly debated topic among scientists is whether there has been mammal-to-mammal transmission of HPAI between seals.

&gt;�It's not surprising that you might have transmission between the seals, because it has happened with low pathogenic avian influenza,� said Puryear. �However, we can't say definitively whether or not there has been mammal-to-mammal transmission of HPAI.�

"&gt;Avian flu is normally difficult to catch from a bird. But of the 15 extant bird flu virus subtypes, H5N1 is particularly worrisome: It mutates rapidly, has a documented propensity to acquire genes from viruses infecting other animal species, and can cause severe disease in humans.

&gt;Unlike seasonal influenza, which usually leads to only mild respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches, H5N1 has caused severe respiratory illness that can lead to rapid deterioration, life-threatening complications, and what appears to be high probability of fatality. Primary viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure are common hallmarks.

&gt;The spread of H5N1 virus from person to person has thus far been rare and not continued beyond one person.13�However, scientists worry that the H5N1 virus may morph into a form that spreads easily from one person to another.

Perhaps the biggest risk of disease concerning livestock and poultry is influenza A - the only influenza virus known to cause pandemics.[\[9\]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm)  It is hypothesized that every influenza virus that causes pandemics in humans is derived from avian influenza in aquatic birds.[\[10\]](https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/152.4_Pt_2.S25)  Normally this wouldn't be an issue for us.  The infected wild birds usually don't get sick, and the virus doesn't easily spread amongst humans.[\[11\]](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(avian-and-other-zoonotic))  But industrialized animal agriculture has changed that.  One scientific review writes:

&gt;Hosts such as swine and gallinaceous poultry that are favorable for transmission and efficient replication of both zoonotic and human viruses can serve as mixing vessels and pose the greatest risk for the development of novel reassortments that can replicate competently in humans.[\[12\]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-018-0642-9)

In other words, livestock and poultry are great at making it easier for viruses to spread amongst humans.  As to why this is, one author explains:

&gt;...virtually every effort to further industrialize broiler [chicken] biology has resulted in the emergence of new risks and vulnerabilities. Intensive confinement combined with increased genetic uniformity has created new opportunities for the spread of pathogens. Increased breast-meat yield has come at the expense of increased immunodeficiency.[\[13\]](http://www.jstor.org/stable/25147798)

It is likely that animal agriculture enabled the 1957 Asian Flu, 1968 Hong Kong Flu,[\[14\]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-010-0008-z) bird flu,[\[15\]](https://dx.doi.org/10.1098%2Frstb.2018.0257) and the 2009 swine flu.[\[16\]](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08182)  Of these, bird flu is the cause for most concern.  In past outbreaks, the case-fatality (CF) rate was 60 percent, although one study suggests that if it became a larger pandemic, it would have a median CF rate of approximately 23.5 percent.[\[17\]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech.2007.064030)  It is thought that the 1918 Spanish Flu may have infected one-third of the global population and had a CF rate of 2.5 percent.[\[18\]](https://dx.doi.org/10.3201%2Feid1201.050979)  If bird flu were to mutate in such a way that it was anywhere near as contagious as Spanish Flu, with a CF rate almost 10 times higher than Spanish Flu, the results would be apocalyptic.  As two authors wrote in a WHO publication:

&gt;We can't scare people enough about H5N1 \[bird flu\].[\[19\]](https://www.psandman.com/articles/MagzEng_05.pdf)

"The problem is that there�s only been a handful of cases. My understanding is that the true mortality rate would be lower, but it�s hard to say how much lower.

From Jan03 to Nov22, there were 868 human cases of H5N1 from 21 countries and, of those 868, 457 were fatal. This is an extremely high case mortality rate, but, because the sample size is so small, it�s hard to know whether that�s a good data set to extrapolate to the global population at large.

Obviously, a new flu strain is never good and strains that mutate from other species tend to be extra bad because our bodies are even less adapted to it, since we�ve never seen much like it.

But there are a ton of factors that could cause the mortality rate to be artificially higher in the 868 cases that were reported. Countries with worse regulations regarding animal handling practices tend to be poorer which tend to have worse access to medical care overall and have poorer health on average because of that. It�s possible that the infections were biased towards people whose immune systems weren�t as robust as somebody in a more developed country due to poorer nutrition and when they got sick, finding adequate medical care was more difficult, meaning they were less likely to get the care that would have kept them alive.

We�ve been dealing with flus for a couple millennia, we�ve gotten pretty good at dealing with them and treating them. They�re still bad, but for the average person, there likely isn�t a lot to have to worry about. Still, no reason not to be careful and practice good hygiene at all times though.

The perfect laboratory of cross species influenza is actually a traditional Old MacDonald type of farm where chickens and swine interact constantly, and where both have access to wild birds.

This influenza virus is out in the wild, indoor factory chickens are less likely to catch it.  The current variant has an incredibly high mortality rate in chickens, it is something like 90% fatal in 48 hours, so farmers have no incentive not to cull a flock as soon as it is identified.  A farmworker is at high risk while culling the flock, but the overall level of contact between birds and humans is minimized, because labor cost is minimal.  A traditional farm is a few dozen chickens in constant close proximity to pigs, cattle. and horses.  Pigs root up tasty insects out of the ground, and manure of cattle and horses attracts all kinds of insects and works that chickens like.  That traditional farm can be managed to be a closed loop that recycles nutrients and energy very efficiently, it is much more sustainable and climate friendly than a factory farm.

The H5N1 avian influenza is notorious for a near *100-percent*  mortality rate in birds. While mammals aren�t catching the virus at the same rate as birds, they aren�t immune to the effects: bird flu has a global WHO mortality rate of greater than *50 percent*  for humans.

So far, the human infections link to contact with an infected bird, which is why the mammal-to-mammal possibility becomes the troubling part of this entire scenario.

It's only a matter of time before the wrong bird cross with the wrong pig. Influenza's ability for Antigenic Shift (combination of genetic material from two separate strains) is no joke. This is the exact process that can eventually lead to a human-to-human transmissable variant of H5N1.,2023-01-09 00:34:09,critical
Several governments already stockpile an h5n1 vaccine.,2023-01-13 22:30:01,informative
"People sometimes gloss over this as being ""an animal disease"" and fail to understand the massive ticking time bomb this is.

Influenza has the ability to share gene segments between different strains. This is called Antigenic Shift. The danger here is that the more this H5N1 strain spreads, the greater the chance it goes through an antigenic shift that drastically alters it, potentially for the worst. All it could take is for the wrong bird to infect the wrong pig, where one of the pigs cells already infected with a different strain of influenza and is also simultaneously infected with the avian H5N1 strain. What could emerge from that cell could be a virus that makes COVID-19 feel like a mild case of allergies. The good news is that we've seen outbreaks of H5N1 in the wild before without it mutating into the strain we all fear. Chances are this outbreak will be no different, but give the virus enough opportunities to spread and it can eventually turn into the nightmare pandemic we fear.

H5N1 is a virus that has shown the ability to cause high levels of lethality in humans (the highly pathogenic strains), easily sitting above 50% and climbing as high as 80% in some outbreaks. So far these infections have been through direct contact with infected birds and has shown very limited human to human transmission, so low it could not become a sustained epidemic. But the effects on its victims is merciless. They drown in a pool of their own liquified lungs as their bodies immune system goes haywire trying to fend off the attacking virus. Other non highly pathogenic strains of avian Influenza have fortunately been less severe, and we'll be very lucky if one of these strains becomes the one to cause an epidemic. Even then, a virus with a 15-20% fatality rate as opposed to 50% or 60% will still be devastating. And the lethality rate doesn't necessarily impact how transmissable the virus is as Influenza can spread before a person even shows any symptoms. Once it has spread, it doesn't really matter if the infected host survived or not, hence the lesser impact the fatality rate has on transmissability.

Two ""gain-of-function"" research studies deliberately modified H5N1 to be transmissable between ferrets (a very close animal analog to humans) and found what would need to happen for it to spread easily between humans. All it took was for a few key mutations in the right places and you could have a very lethal and highly contagious strain of human-to-human H5N1. This was in a lab done with extremely secure measures, but nature is the ultimate biolab. If given enough opportunities, these very same or very similar mutations will eventually emerge naturally.

For decades the one virus that has kept many epidemiologists up at night has been Influenza. Coronavirus did catch us by suprise on a number of times, with COVID being the one pandemic that wasn't exactly expected. That was because the expected and greatly feared super pandemic had been and will likely always be highly pathogenic avian Influenza. Advances in vaccine and treatment research has shortened the time it would take to respond to a pandemic, and this will save millions of lives should the worst come to pass, but until those vaccines are ready and available in mass, our world will be at the mercy of what could be the worst pandemic in human history.",2023-01-13 23:58:27,afraid
"Not the ones currently circulating, those are intended for seasonal strains of influenza which are different from H5N1. There is talk of a strategic reserve of experimental vaccines for a potential HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak, but those are in limited numbers and will only likely go to vital and essential sectors. New experimental mRNA vaccines are being developed, and there's some promising research into developing an omni-valent vaccine that protects the user against almost any type of Influenza A virus. Those can be a game changer and could turn influenza from a serious threat to society into nothing more than an annoyance.",2023-01-14 00:49:11,informative

"I agree. This is missing from the article - why are we culling the birds? To prevent spread - not just among bird but importantly to humans.

H5N1 is currently difficult to transmit between humans but when people do get infected the mortality rate is reportedly up to 60%. What we don't want is a shift in H5N1 where it becomes highly transmissible between people and remains highly deadly.

Also alarming is that the article referenced hemorrhagic pneumonia in the Mink. There are flu variants that cause hemorrhagic symptoms such as petechiae but generally in the severest cases only. It's not inconceivable that the flu could mutate both for adaptability in humans but also in other unpredictable ways.

This warrants very close monitoring by authorities and necessary countermeasures despite any economic impact. H5N1 is capable of making COVID look like dress rehearsal. We have been comforted by its inability to sustain human transmission, but that could change, and if it does, it will likely be due to a similar scenario as outlined in the article.

If it did go full pandemic, it's likely the mortality ratio would come down some, especially in countries with robust and modern health care.

Perhaps the biggest risk of disease concerning livestock and poultry is influenza A - the only influenza virus known to cause pandemics.[\[9\]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm)  It is hypothesized that every influenza virus that causes pandemics in humans is derived from avian influenza in aquatic birds.[\[10\]](https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/152.4_Pt_2.S25)  Normally this wouldn't be an issue for us.  The infected wild birds usually don't get sick, and the virus doesn't easily spread amongst humans.[\[11\]](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(avian-and-other-zoonotic))  But industrialized animal agriculture has changed that.  One scientific review writes:

&gt;Hosts such as swine and gallinaceous poultry that are favorable for transmission and efficient replication of both zoonotic and human viruses can serve as mixing vessels and pose the greatest risk for the development of novel reassortments that can replicate competently in humans.[\[12\]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-018-0642-9)

In other words, livestock and poultry are great at making it easier for viruses to spread amongst humans.  As to why this is, one author explains:

&gt;...virtually every effort to further industrialize broiler [chicken] biology has resulted in the emergence of new risks and vulnerabilities. Intensive confinement combined with increased genetic uniformity has created new opportunities for the spread of pathogens.

In past outbreaks, the case-fatality (CF) rate in humans was 60 percent, although one study suggests that if it became a larger pandemic, it would have a median CF rate of approximately 23.5 percent.[\[17\]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech.2007.064030)  It is thought that the 1918 Spanish Flu may have infected one-third of the global population and had a CF rate of 2.5 percent.[\[18\]](https://dx.doi.org/10.3201%2Feid1201.050979)  If bird flu were to mutate in such a way that it was anywhere near as contagious as Spanish Flu, with a CF rate almost 10 times higher than Spanish Flu, the results would be apocalyptic.

"""Last fall, on a mink farm in Spain, H5N1 (avian influenza) likely spread across the animals. The outbreak resulted in the death or culling of the entire group of 50,000 minks.

Why should you care? Because it may have marked the first known case of mammal-to-mammal transmission of the deadly virus known as the bird flu, according to a new study. And that doesn�t portend anything good for humans.


The H5N1 avian influenza is notorious for a near *100-percent*  mortality rate in birds. While mammals aren�t catching the virus at the same rate as birds, they aren�t immune to the effects: bird flu has a global WHO mortality rate of greater than *50 percent*  for humans.

So far, the human infections link to contact with an infected bird, which is why the mammal-to-mammal possibility becomes the troubling part of this entire scenario. If a mammal, such as a mink, can become an intermediary host, the virus can then mutate to pose an even greater risk to other mammals, including humans.""

""And so what�s concerning about this,� Louise Moncla, a University of Pennsylvania school of veterinary medicine assistant professor, tells CBC News, �is that this is exactly the kind of scenario you would expect to see that could lead to this type of adaptation, that could allow these viruses to replicate better in other mammals�like us.�",2023-02-03 02:11:04,concerned

&gt;About 15 years ago, A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996(H5N1) (briefly Gs/Gd/96), the precursor of currently circulating H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), was identified in farmed geese at Sanshui, Foshan, a rural area in southern China (Wan, 1998). Since then, this emerging H5N1 HPAIV has spread across Asia, Europe and Africa and caused more than 600 human cases and millions of deaths in birds (WHO, 2012, Peiris et al., 2007), and these numbers are still increasing. Thus, these H5N1 HPAIVs pose a continuing threat to both animal and human health. Currently, how and where Gs/Gd/96-like H5N1 viruses emerged are not understood fully.

&gt;In the past three decades, the domestic poultry and animal population sizes have increased dramatically. For instance, in Guangdong Province, the chicken meat production in 1995 doubled from that in 1990, and the pork production in 2004 increased 70% over that in 1990 and 300% over that in 1980 (Guangdong Statistical Bureau, 2005). These large industrialized chicken and swine production units have becoming an important part of the influenza ecosystem (Fig. 2). This surge of domestic animal and bird population increases the likelihood of contacts among domestic, commercial and wild animals.

It likely did provide some form of protection at the time. I remember seeing entire flocks of Canadian Geese dead or dying and people in hazmat suits disposing of them. The thing about influenza is that its RNA is so fragile that it mutates quickly.  It's called antigenic drift and when influenza gets into a significant population  (significant human-to-human transmission) it's enough antigenic drift for former vaccines to be less (or not at all effective). This is why every year there is a new vaccine for the prevalent flu strains. Luckily influenza almost always mutates into a lesser virulent (and less deadly) version but what is worrying especially about H5N1 is that it is almost completely novel to humans and there is no built-in protection from it.,2023-02-03 17:53:02,concerned

H5N1 can be transmitted via fecal matter but for it to be spread that much in a seal population i guess only time and analysis will tell.

"Couple things. If the virus mutates in a way to jump to humans with easy person to person transmission, there is no guarantee it will maintain a high mortality rate. Second the high mortality rate we see are with people who are obviously infected and sick. Like COVID you would have asymptomatic infections with this too so in all likelihood the mortality rate would be lower. All that said, the possibility of a mortality rate much higher than COVID is a real possibility here. COVID had an overall mortality of I think .4% or so. If you were to crank down H5N1 to just 10% mortality you can see how bad things would be. You can't make a direct comparison as they are different flu viruses, but the 1918 flu was a bird flu as well which was pretty bad. It had an estimated mortality rate of 2.5%.

In October, a large outbreak occurred on a mink fur farm in Spain. Researchers who described the outbreak in a paper published last month believe that **wild birds initially transmitted H5N1 to the mink farm, but once there, it spread from mink to mink.**



**�This outbreak signals the very real potential for the emergence of mammal-to-mammal transmission,�** Michelle Wille, a wild bird virus researcher at the University of Sydney, told the CBC.



None of the workers, who wore protective gear, at the farm seem to have gotten infected. But some scientists worry that minks could be a kind of stepping stone for the virus to make a jump to humans.

"BACKGROUND: H5N1 has spread through avian populations over the past few years in what is described as the widest known outbreak to date. Infections were found in areas that have not been affected previously. H5N1 has shown the ability to infect mammals in isolated cases.

H5N1 is responsible for the culling of several mink farms because H5N1 appears to have mutated to facilitate mammal to mammal transmission, still awaiting final confirmation. It's also suspected in some other mammal species suffering disease such as seals.

This is noteworthy because H5N1 had not demonstrated the ability to do so in any documented fashion beyond an isolated case here and there, including the current outbreak. The concern is not only did the virus adapt to mammals, but minks which share some similarities to humans, which would indicate this threat is legitimate. Scientists are describing it as a mechanism that has the ability to cause a pandemic.

However, this does not mean imminent. It bears pointing out no humans were infected in these mink forms. They used PPE such as masks and gloves. The odds are still in our favor it won't jump to humans, especially if public health oriented cullings continue to be utilized.

H5N1 has a nasty CFR in excess of 50%. However, this is based on a very small sample size with cases from a variety of locations with differing levels of health care. It only includes people sick enough to go to the hospital, not asymptomatic or people mildly infected. The bottom line is it has the potential to be very deadly, but as we saw with COVID, there's alot of factors and variables that determine mortality.

Also, viruses are known to trade mobility for mortality, so if it did jump, it's possible it could lose some lethality in order to allow a farther spread. Again, another variable.

There is an H5N1 vaccine produced in limited stocks, but it is able to be scaled up and mass produced. H5N1 may mutate to allow the jump to humans, but updating a flu virus vaccine is doable.

This is a big deal, but don't lose any sleep just yet. It's good for this to get some awareness. Vigilance in affected industries, wildlife observers, and even everyday people may allow us to stop the threat before it can materialize.",2023-02-05 18:47:57,concerned

I could argue we are less prepared now than before COVID. COVID left room for interpretation whether it was dangerous as science made it out to be because of how inconsistently it affected people. Many people never even had symptoms or mild symptoms.

H5N1 will likely leave no such room for interpretation if it goes pandemic. It will be plainly evident that there is a dangerous disease present. While I wouldn't expect it to continue exhibiting a CFR in excess of 50% in that scenario, it's possible. Even if we cut that in half through treatment, it would still be utterly catastrophic for the entire world.

production have undergone intensive selection for fast growth rate and high meat
yield; there is evidence that this process has also reduced their immunity to disease
(Rauw et al. 1998). Intensive selective breeding also results in genetic uniformity in
the population (Delany 2003), making spread of the virus all the more easy.
The evolution towards higher virulence occurs through changes in the surface of the
virus - more specifically, through changes in a protein called haemagluttinin (the �H�
in H5N1) (Swayne and Suarez 2000). Avian Influenza viruses lack �proof-reading�
mechanisms and are therefore unable to repair errors that occur during replication
(Webby et al. 2000 in Webster and Hulse 2004) - this means that the virus
11
continuously accumulates mutations as it reproduces. The more animals that are
kept together in a confined space, the higher the virus load generated and
consequently, the faster changes in the virus can occur. In time, the result is the
emergence of a highly virulent strain of the virus - an HPAI such as H5N1.

OG Covid and Delta were downright dangerous... I was 33 and VERY healthy when I caught Delta and it nearly killed me.

Omicron or whatever the hell I caught again in December was a literal drop in the bucket comparatively... and it's far far a mild cold, but at no point did I write a makeshift will our of fear and delirium like I did with Delta. 21lbs in 21 days fell off me and by the time it was done I was a 6ft tall 145lb skeleton.

I have not lost a single friend or know anyone that has died since Delta ran it's course... before Omicron I stopped counting at 20 people that I knew or knew of that died from Covid-19. I know I'm rare, and most people don't know anyone directly that died from it, but even after facing the hell I have been through I am furious that this is still being played up like it's May 2020.

H5N1 is now an immanent threat... and if it makes the jump it WILL be a REAL pandemic. People don't have a fucking clue that a ""mild"" pandemic before Covid was 10% mortality and 25% mortality was assumed to be a given best case for any novel virus. H5N1 will almost certainly be somewhere in this range IF it makes the jump. This fear mongering will only serve to kill people IF another significant virus decides to go on tour... and like epidemiologist have been saying for decades now ""it's not if, it's when.""

You do know what anaphylaxis is, right?  That's someone having an allergic reaction to an ingredient in the vaccine, generally because they didn't realize ahead of time that they had an allergy.  There are 2 main potential allergenic/immunogenic excipients in COVID-19 vaccines, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polysorbate 80.  You also know anaphylaxis doesn't mean automatic death and it's also treatable, right?

&gt;Africa because it has some of the lowest standards of living and healthcare yet had a fraction of the deaths in comparison to the US (258,000 in Africa compared to 1,400,000 in the US)

"***From Telegraph Global Health's Sarah Newey:***

In a new preprint, scientists in Canada demonstrated that H5N1 samples taken from a red tailed hawk spread efficiently between ferrets � the main �animal model� used by scientists in experiments to analyse how respiratory viruses may impact people.


It is the first study to clearly confirm that the virus can spread from mammal to mammal � although the recent deaths of many animals, including sea lions, have previously suggested this. Analysis of an outbreak at a mink farm in Spain and in seals in New England have also pointed towards spread between mammals.


But the results from Canada suggest that some strains of H5N1 with �certain adaptations that allow for a higher degree of replication, pathogenicity, and transmission� may be spreading.


Over the last 18 months, avian influenza has devastated wild and farmed bird populations across the globe. But there has also been mounting alarm around cases in mammals including foxes, sea lions, dolphins and even domestic cats.


This has created unprecedented opportunities for the virus to shift and reassort � a process where different strains of the same pathogen combine into something new.

Neither of the workers displayed symptoms of the disease and both are now testing negative, the agency said.

There are also no signs that the bird flu H5N1 virus detected in the two cases has jumped to other people, though close contacts of the individuals have been approached by the UKHSA, officials said.

Both cases were picked up by a testing programme carried out by the UKHSA, in which all workers on infected farms in England are tested.

&gt;
&gt;But in the hundreds of cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals, ""the mortality rate is extraordinarily high"", Farrar said.
&gt;
&gt;From 2003 to April 1 this year, the WHO said it had recorded 463 deaths from 889 human cases across 23 countries, putting the case fatality rate at 52 percent.
&gt;
&gt;In a worrying development, US authorities earlier this month said a person in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to dairy cattle.
&gt;
&gt;It was only the second case of a human testing positive for bird flu in the country, and came after the virus sickened herds that were apparently exposed to wild birds in Texas, Kansas and other states.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;He said efforts were under way towards the development of vaccines and therapeutics for H5N1, and stressed the need to ensure that regional and national health authorities around the world have the capacity to diagnose the virus.
&gt;
&gt;This was being done so that ""if H5N1 did come across to humans, with human-to-human transmission"", the world would be ""in a position to immediately respond"", Farrar said, urging equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.

Hopefully we as a society have learned and retained enough from the previous pandemics to be preparing for newer ones that might be developing.

 into cattle, as it�s jumped into so many different species already. The WHO has the human mortality rate for H5N1 at an unbelievably horrific 60%, while there�s a recent published paper that revises that down to a fatality range 11-33%.

By contrast, Covid at its worst was around 1-2% fatality, and the historic Spanish Flu a century ago was at 2-3% fatality.

It�s still very early, and yet the human cases are escalating fast. It�s looking like it�s just a matter of time for us, and it�s really a roll of the dice whether it retains its sky high lethality in the crossover. Judging by how Covid was and is being handled, I don�t have much hope for it being anything better than a poorly managed disaster at every step along the way. Even as it is, thanks to regulatory capture, testing of cattle is up to the farmers and review relies on self reporting by the same farmers, who are of course factoring in profitability of their actions.

"Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), or factory farms, create the perfect storm for diseases like bird flu to spread. Avian influenza that typically spreads naturally through wild birds does not pose much of a risk and generally does little harm to the animals. But when that virus is brought into massive poultry barns, often on contaminated shoes, clothes, machinery, bedding and animal feed, that�s where the problem starts. Industrially farmed chickens, turkeys, and ducks are crammed tightly together in cruel, unsanitary conditions. If one bird gets the flu, these close quarters cause the sickness to spread at alarming rates.

There are two types of bird flu � highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). The first spreads fast and is extremely deadly, with the capacity to kill an entire flock in just 48 hours. The second is not deadly and may not even cause symptoms amongst birds who have it. Mild symptoms include ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production for egg-laying hens.

The former is what has been affecting bird populations and raising a major alarm for scientists, environmentalists, farmers, and animal activists

Many believe that wild birds are the main cause of the spread since governments and the poultry sector usually place the blame there. But in reality, this strain of HPAI originated in the poultry sector on factory farms.

HPAI spreading rapidly in factory farms can cause the virus to mutate into even more harmful strains that can be easily passed to other species, which is how bird flu is now affecting wild birds and other animals. In the past year, bird flu has mutated and diseased other animals across the world and has affected humans too

H5N1, otherwise known as avian influenza or bird flu, has been making headline after headline for tearing through bird populations including commercial flocks (like these three in Missouri that caused farmers to kill a total of 71,800 turkeys), backyard flocks, and even infecting and killing other animals like polar bears and elephant seals.

"Answer:

There is currently an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI or H5N1) in the US. It�s extremely deadly to birds and highly contagious, so if a single bird tests positive, the whole flock must be culled. This is making egg prices skyrocket as poultry farmers are losing millions of chickens to this disease and to culling.

It�s also a little different compared to past HPAI outbreaks because of two factors: 1. it�s mainly transmitted directly by wild birds; and 2. It�s lasted through the summer and winter instead of dying back. Past outbreaks ended much quicker but this one just keeps on going, and is spread through the US by wild birds migrating. It�s the deadliest outbreak yet.

Edit to add: the other factors are that COVID is still impacting supply chains, inflation has driven up the prices of related factors like transporting eggs, and the holidays created even greater demand for eggs. So the egg prices would�ve already been higher but the concurrent HPAI outbreak made them skyrocket.

**Edit 2** to address some misinformation:

**Can people get HPAI?** Yes, and there has already been [at least one case](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0428-avian-flu.html) during the current (2022-2023) outbreak. It is generally very mild in people and the risk of spread among people isn't really a concern at the moment. Proper PPE is still a good idea to prevent bird-to-person-to-bird spread. [There is no risk of getting it from eating eggs or poultry that are properly prepared and cooked.](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/avian-influenza-food-safety-qa.pdf) However, I believe there is a small chance that the carcasses of infected birds can transmit it to still-living birds, so if a bird is known to have had HPAI, the carcass should be cautiously disposed of.

**Why are the birds killed instead of being treated?** The nature of the disease is that it spreads rapidly and kills quickly. By the time the first bird shows symptoms, it likely spread to dozens of other birds, which will likely die within 24-48 hours. It's extremely fatal in chickens and even if treated, most would likely die. Culling the entire exposed flock is the quickest/cheapest/most efficient way of preventing the outbreak of spreading even further.

**What should I do to keep my backyard chickens/ducks/geese safe?** Do not allow them to comingle with wild birds (mostly waterfowl- songbirds are rarely affected). Keep their water and food safe from contaminants like wild goose poop. Clean your shoes before entering their enclosures so you don't bring goose poop and other contaminants into their enclosure from the outside. Track their health and if any show any neurological symptoms, isolate them immediately, disinfect anything they touch, and contact your veterinarian. Also make sure to follow the news in your state to see where and when the closest outbreak is.

States track outbreaks by testing dead birds. This includes birds on farms, and also dead birds found in the wild or who die at a wildlife center. The amount of testing does vary wildly from state to state so some states may be more accurate than others, but unless you work for them, I'm not sure if there's really a way to find out how each states' methodology compares to the others.",2023-01-11 10:30:14,concerned
"Question: Is this the same H5N1 that was in the media in 2006 ish? The one where there was even a made-for-TV doomsday movie about it? Has something changed about H5N1 that makes it only a mild concern nowadays (e.g. better immunization, more focus on other diseases like COVID/other flu viruses), or am I thinking of something different/missing something?",2023-01-11 18:29:30,concerned
"I'm not sure; I'm not a disease expert, but work with wild birds so have been following the current outbreak because it affects my job. All I can really say on the topic is that new strains of H5N1 are constantly evolving and the dominant strain can change from year to year. Different strains can interact with different species in new and unexpected ways. I know that right now there isn't much concern about a human outbreak, even though there has been at least one case of a person contracting the illness, but I don't know what made the 2006 strain specifically harmful to people.",2023-01-11 18:42:08,concerned

"Answer: H5N1 is just known as a typically rough strain of flu. The CDC, as well as every other public health agency, spends all year every year monitoring the flu around the world, to predict which strains are going to emerge as that year's epidemic. Actual *avian flu* is rare in humans, but does happen. When it does, it's extremely bad news, with a high fatality rate. However unlike H1N3 that we see every few years, avian H5N1 is a bird virus that doesn't transmit easily between humans. The concern is that over the last few years (well, decades) we've seen H5N1 spread from primarily southeast Asia around the world. The CDC has not detected human-to-human transmission in North America, but it's very important to keep vigilant. It's bad news for poultry farmers, and one reason for sky-high chicken prices right now.

As for the fungal part, I'm not sure what you're referring to. I know mainstream news has been talking about Candida auris recently, but that's actually years-old news that for some reason just got picked up. It's just a relatively newly-described species of yeast that tends to be resistant to multiple antifungals. But like other Candida species, it's an opportunistic pathogen. It's of interest to public health and hospital labs, but is still very uncommon and for the average person nothing to think about.",2023-03-24 20:21:21,skeptical
"One difference here is that we already have vaccines against the flu, and they work pretty well. My understanding is that an H5N1 vaccine has already been developed. Of course, people might be infected before the vaccine rollout, and there will be people who refuse it, but having a good vaccine already available will prevent it from doing the damage that COVID did.",2024-05-02 10:37:59,concerned
"No need to worry.

There have been FDA approved vaccinations (non mRNA) for H5N1 since 2007. Currently there are 8 tested and approved vaccines. One of which has been been stockpiled since 2013.",2024-05-02 12:44:30,unconcerned
"There's also antivirals that can treat it as well. Unlike COVID was which a completely new virus, H5N1 has been known about and studied for decades.",2024-05-03 22:32:52,concerned
"In addition, the US is close to deal with Moderna to fund a late-stage trial for a mRNA vaccine for H5N1. There's also antivirals that can treat it as well.",2024-06-02 15:22:44,concerned
"It's so cool to see this exact post now posted by different names across many of my previous comments in my history, including responding to one comment about the movie Paddington 2. Not super creepy at all.

Also, really neat to start off your comment with undercutting someone else, whom you don't know and have never interacted with, just by saying they don't think critically, and then going into an analysis of all the articles and specifically quote out saying exactly that gains-of-function happen all the time in viruses. Honestly, if not for the quote texting across my account, I would think you were embarrassing.

In fact, under the scenario that viruses always attenuate, how would you even explain covid or H5N1 existing at all? Of course viral genetic drift can either make viruses more or less deadly, but the deadliness of the virus has nothing to do with selective advantage, and there just isn't any evidence that supports that as the case.",2024-06-03 16:02:53,informative
