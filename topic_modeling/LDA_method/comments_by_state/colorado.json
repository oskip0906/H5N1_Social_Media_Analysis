I still think it is interesting. I swabbed raw meat samples from 7 stores in Boulder and Longmont, including two ethnic meat suppliers in Longmont. Selections from each store included vertebral cuts (T-bone, etc). The \"ethnic\" cuts additionally included lengua (tongue of course), and machitos (intestine). \r\n\r\nThere were 17 samples in all. Control tests for each sample were done using swabs from regular Spam swabs(now is when you can laugh). \r\n\r\nResults:\r\nControls: zero positives.\r\nsamples: 3 positives for H5N1, 14 negatives\r\nZero inconclusive/failed tests.\r\n\r\nThe three positive samples were retained and re-tested, along with a random selection of three negative samples. All  three negative samples were negative again, and all three positive samples were positive again. \r\n\r\nThe positive samples were each cooked in a pan at 460-485F on one side so than a thermometer read two different temperatures: For each of the two positive vertebral samples, placed adjacent to the bone to read to medium rare (130F-135F) and medium well (150F-155F), respectively, and for the machitos sample, at the center of a ball of the sample to read at 155F.  The samples were removed form the pan onto individual chilled glass Pyrex casseroles to rest for 5 minutes, and then swabs identical or comparable to tests numbers 1 &amp; 2 for each sample were taken, along with three Spam controls (at room temp) for each. The vertebral sample cooked to 152F tested positive. The other two tests were negative. The controls were all negative. \r\n\r\nNo positive controls were available. No supplier would sell me H5N1 protein or RNA fragments to test with. And again, this test protocol was done outside of the printed label, and so the specificity and sensitivity is very much in question, or even the validity of the entire test. However, I am told that all samples were delicious after final preparation to a well done state (or broiled, in the case of the machitos). \r\n\r\nThis proves nothing, of course. The tests, when used properly (which these were not), are very likely to react with and report on H5N1 specific antigens. It just suggests that beef should be investigated as an obvious potential vector for exposure to viable H5N1 virus. The FDA is doing exactly that as I write this now, and not because I've been asking just about every email address I can find in zoonotic virology research to consider the possibility after completing this test. It was an obvious direction for any researcher to go. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/usda-beef-bird-flu/index.html\r\n\r\nGround beef (used in the government testing) generally contains a much higher level of nervous tissue that might be  associated with certain viral pathogens. I'm glad they are doing this for H5N1. It is unlikely they will report on any of the other viral antigen loads in the samples since RT-PCR is exceptionally target sensitive. \r\n\r\nAs for H5N1 in milk, zero viral plaque forming units (PFU's) have, to date, been found from raw or pasteurized milk samples (in other words, the RNA was there but no detectable potentially viable viral particles). There are few cases where the association with raw milk consumption is strongly suspected in humans, but there are some. In previous studies, PCR fragments from a large variety of viruses has always been present, and are now joined by H5N1, again with zero PFU results in pasteurized samples, and very few in raw samples. \r\n\r\nIt is still very easy to pasteurize milk if you are a small producer. It takes us about five minutes to get it going before starting dinner, five minutes to end in  a pail of water to chill after reaching 161F after getting ready to eat dinner, and almost nothing to clean up. That's enough for a few days to a week. \r\nOur milk is still warm from the udders before pasteurization in general, and it goes into the fridge immediately after processing. If equipment is spotlessly clean (and it should be), and animals are healthy, there is no way even for pathogenic bacteria to become a problem. But in the real world, things happen, and people get seriously sick occasionally and unnecessarily. It's not worth it in my opinion, given how easy pasteurization is.", "Not anymore.

If things continue as they are there will be chronic outages, though I don't think we've quite crossed that watershed YET we are headed that direction.\r\n\r\nEdit: the immediate \"this week\" outage is probably a combination of things -- most notably, something like Thanksgiving converges pretty much ALL sales patterns into a single event, and it is to be expected that there would be a run on grocery stores 5-8 days later.\r\n\r\nMost of the year you might go once a week, your neighbor every 5 days, a different neighbor twice a week, etc -- the buyer at the grocery store can more or less estimate that large-scale 'average' pattern. But a bottleneck event like Thanksgiving pinches everything into one event, which is known/obvious, but the followup is also important. People will \"run out\" at more or less the same time following the holiday and need to restock...everyone at once. If the buyer at the store did not plan for THAT convergence they could be caught flat in any case and add to that a reduction in production...and you have empty shelves.\r\n\r\nAs individual's buying patterns re-establish and spread out over the next week or two the store-level averaging patterns will re-establish themselves and you should see a return to normal.\r\n\r\nThat said, prices will continue to rise regardless until this round of the flu passes but at an industry level (not the farm level) I expect the normal sequence of hatch-raise-lay for hens will continue as they have been throughout the bird pandemic and supply should be maintained.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, the fact that sunflower prices are up (see: Ukraine/Russia, drought in the US, etc) means other oil-seeds will also rise, they tend to move as a set.

Just look up.", "Did you even read the article you posted? I don\u2019t think it says what you think it says. It talks about how due to **supply issues** the firm with the least amount of avian flu is making the most amount of money. There is absolutely nothing surprising about that. \r\n\r\nIf Walmart is willing to pay out the ass for eggs - **because of supply issues** - then that\u2019s what people will sell eggs for. There are supply issues. This is not disputed. This has driven up the cost of eggs. That\u2019s how it works with all assets under supply constraints. \r\n\r\nI can tell how smart and educated you are because you resort to insults. Just like Carl Sagan and Einstein.", "&gt;\tThe egg industry is scapegoating a bunch of things (like bird flu) so they can gouge the market.\r\n\r\nLol this is the most Reddit comment ever. \u201caCtUALlY ThErE ARE No iSsUeS WiTh sUpPly anD DeMaND tHe rEAL isSuE Is cOmPaniES hAVE JuSt nOw dIsCoVeReD GREeD\u201d\r\n\r\nThe data says [otherwise](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/briefing/why-eggs-cost-so-much.html). \u201cEight years ago, about 43 million egg-laying birds died as a result of avian flu.

Supply shocks (like bird flu) would lead to price run-ups and those windfalls were used to pad the next downturn.\r\n\r\nToday, for the most part, the industry has become so consolidated that processors can retain market power even as their prices surge, and if the market turns against them they can push worse market conditions on both their customers and suppliers.", "Many zoos rehomed their free-roam peacocks because of the huge Avian influenza outbreak back in 2015, I believe. Since then a lot of zoos re-evaluated the care for them and determined it was best to not have them.

Not sure of the specifics of your ethical acquisition, but if you literally just found it dead and picked it up, please don't forget we're still in the midst of a very serious Avian Influenza outbreak and take extra PPE precautions, *especially* for a bird that has no obvious cause of death.\r\n\r\n(Also, while house sparrows are one of the very few species not covered under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act so you're good in this case, it is usually very illegal to collect bird remains of most kinds in the US unless you're doing something like donating them to an organization with valid permits, like above.

The case occurred in Delta County this April, when an individual came in direct contact with diseased poultry by doing culling at a commercial farm. The individual did not experience any severe symptoms, and there was no other transmission following this.\r\n\r\nI would also note that a Google News search shows other articles about this subject and it looks like the issue is with birds. It's a disaster for agriculture due to how contagious and potentially fatal this is for birds.\r\n\r\nHowever, it  does not appear to be a major issue with humans at this time--certainly not the next COVID-19, if that's what anyone has in mind.", "Cage free won\u2019t mitigate avian flu outbreaks. It\u2019s very slightly more space than cages but they are mostly still in big buildings and packed tightly on a big floor. They have to have at least 1sqft of space per chicken. Battery cages are way worse because they can\u2019t move at all but a similar amount of space. Some are better than others though. It\u2019s definitely more humane. \r\n\r\nPasture raised is where they actually have space. The eggs are noticeably different too.", "This is Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. It\u2019s been in Eurasia for awhile, but it jumped to North America recently. We could actually watch it spread down the flyways as birds migrate. \r\n\r\nHPAI has already been transmitted between birds and humans a few times, and my understanding is that it has a pretty high mortality rate (flu is pretty dangerous in general, this one more so). The caveat there being that that\u2019s hard to determine without many cases. However, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, these viruses mutate. Not only do we want to prevent anyone from getting HPAI, we really don\u2019t want this to be a strain that\u2019s spreading from human to human. \r\n\r\nThe biologists I know who have handled birds who have died of HPAI have worn full PPE, like suits and a mask. \r\n\r\nAll that is to say, it\u2019s worth being aware and cautious, as we should with any infectious disease.", "Damn...
