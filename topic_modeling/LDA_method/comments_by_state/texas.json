Also, if you are actively avoiding handling and consuming raw OR undercooked beef, eggs, chicken, milk, cheese, etc, your risk is extremely low.\n\nFrom my understanding, the virus has not reached human to human transmission. All confirmed human infections are from people who interacted with sick/infected animals/spaces.\n\nThe virus does need to go through certain mutations to be able to become human to human transmissible.\n\nONE of these mutations has been confirmed, but it needs to go through multiple mutations.\n\nIF the virus is detected in pigs, these mutations become more likely and the risk becomes greater.\n\nOther animals interacting with infected farm animals have fallen ill with quite severe symptoms and have died, including farm cats as well as a domestic NON farm cat, so the virus may be spreading to other cats outside of these farms.\n\nOwners should keep their cats indoors, and also make sure their dogs don't try to lick/eat bird poop or raw/undercooked beef/eggs/dairy(if you feed your pet a raw/freeze dried diet, this is a legitimate concern).\n\nThe CDC has highly recommended farm workers wear appropriate PPE, but they essentially said the CDC can f\u2022ck off and that they won't take extra necessary precautions.\n\nBut, as of right now, in this moment and stage of the virus, I wouldn't be too concerned if you're being careful about what you and your pets consume. Maybe also avoid spending time with any friends or family that actively work on at risk farms if you want to be extra extra extra cautious. This would be moreso due to if they have virus particles on their person from farm animal feces/fluids that you could pick up, not so much about any human to human transmission risk.\n\nAdditionally, the appropriate entities have stated that an adequate vaccine specifically for H5N1 could be created in a matter of weeks with an expedited rollout in the event that it does become human to human.\n\nThe greatest risk is in those early weeks/months before people can get vaccinated, so at the earliest confirmation of any human to human spread, just make some life changes and be extra careful(we all know how different people will handle this stage based on the Covid pandemic).", "Because of the near 100 % mortality in wild birds (largely passerines)  and commercial chicken and turkey flocks ,and potential virulency when it jumps to humans (aout 50% mortality) global monitoring of of H5N1  and its \"cousins\" has been a top priority since the late nineties.  H5N1 highly pathogenic avian flu is highly mutable and often described as \"the big one\" by virologists and epidemiologists. Covid is referred to as \"preparedness practice\" for a H5N1 human pandemic.  I feel relieved that many countries are alert, have been historically prepared or beginning to prepare. Many have stockpiled somewhat effective antivirals and prototype vaccines. The vaccine use \"old technology' and would require many months to ramp up production...that is a worry.  I hope we are working on new fast technology vaccines.  \n\n  \nWhat can we do? \n\n1.Pressure the FDA and related federal agencies  to ramp up monitoring and reporting of H5N1 in wild mammals (48 species to date have been affected), in commercial animal stock including dairy and beef cattle, and pigs and goats. Infections in pigs are especially concerning as we share similar genetic vulnerabilities\" to many pathogens.\n\n3. Begin informing and educating the public, and listening to farmers. I have been impressed with local responses in the chicken and dairy industry. Farmers are very worried . They need the latest information as it emerges. But I worry that politics and money will carry more weight than public health. the FDA and associated federal agencies have their heads in the sand about this.  The public needs to be better informed and risks. \n\n4. Always be personally prepared for epidemics and pandemics. \n\n  \nWhere to go for information?  \n\n1. I go to PubMed , where you can find all scientific papers and government documents from every country. But the papers are difficult going. Still if you want to try - do a search on avian flu in humans and limit it to the year 2023- 2024. I also go to the virology chat rooms. The science is pretty heavy but you can see the science reported without fear of government repercussions .. remember what happened to the chinese scientists and doctors who tried to warn about Covid in late 2019?\n\n2. The WHO is more informative than the CDC.  \n\n3. Media? Its tough to separate the fact from the fake.  As a biologist who teaches students to separate science fact from fake science the media source that is most scientifically/medically correct is the New York Times science section. ..not the editorials.  Many of the other media sources are loaded with disinformation.\n\n4. Science News is an on line journal that takes the latest science and reviews it for the public. Its excellent.\n\n5. I find it most useful to do a google search on : Avian Flu and set the date screen to most recent. Glance through the headings from scientific, academic and health sites to get a feel about the global and local impacts. Do look at new reports from our agricultural belts. See what our farmers and ranchers  are experiencing .\n\n6. Avoid social media and conspiracy websites .. you want the cleanest, least politicized science and medicine  so you can make the most informed decision.\n\nFaye", "Surely you find a difference between killing animals for food and killing animals for superstition? Additionally, while far from perfect, society as a whole has decided that even livestock animals have certain rights and protections. Sure, those protections are not respected more often than not, but the fucking compass is pointed SOMEWHERE, which is the avoidance of unduly pain whenever possible. Which is why chickens are electrocuted before slaughter, and cows stunted, and pigs killed with as much precision as possible. And sometimes when abuses do make it to the public, people go to jail and factories are fined. An amateur decapitating a dove they likely purchased from some crowded, unregulated backyard facility doesn\u2019t take any of this considerations, they goal is indeed to cause the animal pain. Also noteworthy, birds are notorious for carrying viruses that easily make the animal-human jump, so regulated animal facilities go to great pains to monitor flock health, and medicate as needed or cull the entire flock in the presence of avian flu or other threats to human health.

Probably worse out in the rich neighborhoods out west, but not impossible in the flatland neighborhoods.   Stay out of the obvious fire death zones with hills and lots of trees.

It will take significantly more time for the herd to bounce back due to the loss of not only live cattle, but unborn as well. \n\nWhere in the bill does it reference H5N1?"], "Topic 9": ["In early February, dairy farmers in the Texas Panhandle began to notice sick cattle. Nearly 60 days passed before veterinarians identified the culprit: a highly pathogenic strain of the bird flu virus, H5N1. Had it been detected sooner, the outbreak might have been swiftly contained. Now it has spread to at least eight other states, and it will be hard to eliminate.\u00a0\n\nWhy did it take so long to recognize the virus on high-tech farms in the world\u2019s richest country? Because even though H5N1 has circulated for nearly three decades, its arrival in dairy cattle was most unexpected. Tests for contagious diseases known to whip through herds came up negative. Some farmers wondered if the illness was related to ash from wildfires devastating land to the east.\n\nAn early indication that something had gone awry on farms in northwestern Texas came from devices hitched to collars on dairy cows. Darren Turley, executive director of the Texas Association of Dairymen, describes them as \u201can advanced fitness tracker.\u201d They collect a stream of data, such as a cow\u2019s temperature, its milk quality, and the progress of its digestion \u2014 or, rather, rumination \u2014 within its four-chambered stomach. What farmers saw when they downloaded the data in February stopped them in their tracks. One moment a cow seemed perfectly fine, and then four hours later, rumination had halted. \u201cShortly after the stomach stops, you\u2019d see a huge falloff in milk,\u201d Turley said. \u201cThat is not normal.\u201d\n\nIn hindsight, Turley wished he had made more of the migrating geese that congregate in the panhandle each winter and spring. Geese and other waterfowl have carried H5N1 around the globe. They withstand enormous loads of the virus without getting sick, passing it on to local species, like blackbirds, cowbirds, and grackles, that mix with migrating flocks. But with so many other issues facing dairy farmers, geese didn\u2019t register.\u00a0\n\nSometime in March, viruses appear to have hitched a ride to other states as cows were moved between farms. The limited genomic data available links the outbreak in Texas directly to others in New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota. However, the routes are imprecise because the USDA hasn\u2019t attached dates and locations to data it releases.\n\nResearchers don\u2019t want to be caught off guard again by the shape-shifting H5N1 virus, and that will require keeping tabs on humans. Most, if not all, of about 900 people diagnosed with H5N1 infections worldwide since 2003 acquired it from animals, rather than from humans, Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at the World Health Organization said. About half of those people died.\n\nOccasional tests of sick farmworkers aren\u2019t sufficient, he said. Ideally, a system is set up to encourage farmworkers, their communities, and health care workers to be tested whenever the virus hits farms nearby.", "Lol well what\u2019s inflation 6%-10% \nThat does not even come close to the rise in egg prices.

So, the \u201cflu\u201d refers to a group of viruses that are genetically related, but are not all identical. In fact, there are hundreds of different viruses that can cause the flu! There are a few hundred different breeds of dogs, so you can think of it like that - a dog is a dog, but there are hundreds of different kinds with distinct features, and there are also tons of possibilities of genetic mashups to make mutts. We can group dogs into categories; for example, large, medium, and small, or we could group them by function like tracking or hunting or novelty or whatever. You get the idea. We do the same with flu viruses; categorize them into functional groups. That\u2019s why you might hear things like Flu A versus Flu B, or you might hear someone mention the H5N1 group versus H1N1, for example. \n\nNow, every year a group of smart, appropriately-educated and experienced folks use sophisticated computer algorithms to predict which of the hundreds of different strains of flu are likely to be the most prevalent in the upcoming season. Any given vaccine can only contain antigens from maybe four different strains of the flu (\u201cantigen\u201d is what we call an identifier that your immune system can use to recognize the virus; think of it like being given a photo of a chihuahua so you could later recognize that breed of dog if you saw one at the park). So each year the experts say, what are the four strains of flu that we are most worried about? Which are the top viruses that could make the most people sick this year, or that could cause the most harm in infected individuals? Once those have been identified, they are packaged up into a vaccine. \n\nThe vaccine is very effective at preventing illness from those four top flu viruses. But, again, there are hundreds of flu viruses! Just like dogs though, some breeds are very similar to each other, so the flu vaccine can also be protective for many other strains that happen to be similar to the four included in the shot. And there are even more strains that are not similar enough for the vaccine to prevent disease; however, they are juuust similar enough for your body to go, \u201chmm, this seems familiar, I think I know what to do here!\u201d and the illness is relatively mild or short. \n\nPlus, if you get a flu shot every year, then every year your body is learning about new variations of the flu. Even if the flu shot \u201cwears off\u201d after a while, your body at least has that experience under its belt, and in the future if you\u2019re exposed to a variation of the virus that you were vaccinated for several years ago, you might get sick, but it may still be more mild than it would have been if you weren\u2019t getting vaccinated. \n\nHowever, here\u2019s the thing. There are still hundreds of these little suckers and every now and then, you\u2019re going to encounter one that is totally new to your body, or is just some kind of mutt of a virus that your immune system doesn\u2019t quickly recognize. If you don\u2019t get vaccinated regularly, this is more likely to occur, but it can happen to anyone. When it happens, you get sick with the flu. Sometimes really sick. And it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you got your flu shot that particular year, because this virus is not one of the ones in the vaccine. It\u2019s a random troll you picked up somewhere, and it\u2019s going to take your body a while to mount a specified immune response and figure out the best way to get rid of it. And that is how, even after receiving the flu shot, you can still get the worst flu of your life. But it\u2019s also the reason why you *should* get the flu shot every single year, to lessen the chances you will encounter a strain totally foreign to your immune system.", "oh shit dude.

That\u2019s when we first developed what our plan looked like, \\[as well as\\] some of our requirements and business implications. In 2009, we actually used that plan in response to H1N1, when [**the swine flu came to fruition in Cibolo**](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103744903), and refined it, made it more of an influenza plan. We\u2019ve continued to revise it, and it\u2019s been a part of our preparedness plan at H-E-B ever since.\u00a0 \n\n**Craig Boyan, president, H-E-B:** Justen leads our emergency preparedness with a group of folks, and that is a full-time, year-round position. We are constantly in a year-round state of preparedness for different emergencies. We keep emergency supplies at almost every warehouse and have water and other supplies staged and ready to go and kept in storage to make sure that we are ready to \\[react quickly\\] when a crisis emerges, whether it be a hurricane or a pandemic. We take being a strong emergency responder in Texas, to take care of Texas communities, very seriously.\u00a0 \n\n**Tina James,** **chief people officer, H-E-B:** For example, when we saw what was happening with the volume, we asked at corporate if people wanted to volunteer to take shifts in the stores and at the warehouses. We immediately had hundreds\u2014800 corporate folks volunteered for 350, 400 shifts in our stores and warehouses, to be able to help out and give some relief to our stores.\u00a0\n\n**Stephanie Lowe, customer**: I met Alma, who has been with H-E-B for 21 years, if I recall, and works in the store\u2019s bookkeeping department.

But they're still in unsanitary conditions, and develop new health problems. In addition, workers in these barns are experiencing respiratory issues from all the dust and chicken waste and also physical injuries from the ergonomic demands of having to gather eggs in a setting that's less of a factory than with caged eggs.\n\nhttps://nyti.ms/29Y58As\n\nFree range doesn't mean what most people think it does - it just means they have to have access to the outside.

Globalists.", "the hens didn\u2019t all die from avian flu, they were culled", "More than yikes, bird flu is no joke", "&gt;In the case of unborn livestock death losses incurred on or after January 1, 2024,\n\nI don't see no expiration date, so any gestating cattle that die from H5N1 seem to fit the bill"]}
