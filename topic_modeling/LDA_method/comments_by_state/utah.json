Luxury is just a branding term. None of the \"luxury\" apartments are anything special. It's all just new housing that they want to pretend is flashy. \n\n2) that's exactly my point. We've chronically underbuilt housing, (and pretty reliably only allowed single family home) for at least since the financial crisis in 08 and probably before. We're so short on housing that vacancy rates are at an all time low, even at high prices! It seems obvious to me that replacing a few single family homes with 100 apartments is a clear win because we need the housing!

You got shitty 100 year old tiny houses selling for over a million because people want to live there! \n\nRemember when egg prices jacked up last year like crazy?

If there is a low supply and a high demand for a specific commodity (i.e. housing), the price will be high. In order to bring the price down, there either needs to be an increase in supply or a decrease in demand.\n\nBuilding more houses increases the overall supply, thus lowering the price.\n\nAnother example is eggs. The price of eggs has increased dramatically recently because of an egg shortage due to a bird flu (avian influenza) outbreak that occurred over a year ago. The outbreak caused a drop in the number of chickens which then lead to a decrease in egg yield later on. The demand for eggs didn't change, but the supply went down. This caused the price of eggs to skyrocket. The only way to decrease the price of eggs (without government intervention) is to increase the supply of eggs. Until the supply of eggs increases enough to match the demand, expect high egg prices.\n\nSimilarly, until the supply of housing in SLC increases to match the demand, expect high housing prices.", "Not likely that you\u2019ll find a pet home that will take your hens.
