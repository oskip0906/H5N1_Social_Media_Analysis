Both times all their sides were noticeably worse. I don\u2019t think their Mac is homemade anymore (or at least its more apparent it\u2019s made elsewhere) and the beans were really stale too. Have they been this way before the pandemic and I just now notice? Or is this a recent development?

Overall it seems things have gotten more lax there.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if they were just having an off-day both times, or if only the Easton Location is bad, but I just figured the supply chain problems have been making them cut a lot of corners.

I\u2019m not calling you a conspiracy theorist, I don\u2019t know you and I don\u2019t know how serious you are about this idea. But I like breaking down this kind of thing\u2026\r\n\r\n\u201cI found a dead bird in my yard. There are no apparent injuries, so the explanation isn\u2019t obvious.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with this as an observation by itself, but the next step before adopting any explanation would be to come up with a testable hypothesis. \u201cI don\u2019t see another explanation\u201d is not the same thing as \u201cthere is no other explanation.\u201d It\u2019s called an argument from ignorance fallacy: I don\u2019t know any other explanation, so I\u2019ve adopted this one. \r\n\r\n\u201cThere are harmful chemicals in the air due to the East Palestine incident. Last night it rained and now there\u2019s a dead bird. Could it be related?\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain, as a question, there\u2019s nothing fundamentally wrong with asking this. But a suggested explanation shouldn\u2019t be adopted without clear evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s possible\u201d is not the same thing as \u201cit\u2019s actual.\u201d Plus, one would need to demonstrate that a specific explanation is even possible before offering it. Has it been demonstrated to be possible for chemicals to travel from East Palestine to Dayton through clouds and rain? If it\u2019s not shown to be possible, it\u2019s not a candidate explanation. \r\n\r\nAnd correlation is not causation. \u201cMy rooster crowed this morning and the sun came up. My rooster must have caused the sunrise!\u201d Two things happening near each other doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a causal link. \r\n\r\nFurther, we have a single dead bird being floated as a possible pattern. We haven\u2019t established a pattern yet, but let\u2019s say we did. Let\u2019s say more dead birds are found\u2026 maybe 5, maybe 10, maybe 1000. Maybe every single bird in Ohio drops out of the sky and dies. We would still need evidence to demonstrate a link between the events in East Palestine and the death of the birds. Simply assuming or asserting a connection is not sufficient, it must be demonstrated. \r\n\r\nMaybe, as another commenter pointed out, it\u2019s avian flu. Maybe there are toxic chemicals in the air from the train derailment AND there\u2019s also something else killing birds. Both could be true. Conspiracy thinking tends to adopt a simple explanation quickly, without considering all options. (Simple meaning satisfying to the person; it doesn\u2019t mean conspiracy theories can\u2019t be complex or complicated. Look at the various features included in OP\u2019s potential explanation)\r\n\r\nConspiracy thinkers also fixate on anomalies. They focus on specific details which stand out or don\u2019t seem to fit, while sometimes ignoring or missing other data. There may be hundreds of living birds flying around OP\u2019s house, but they\u2019ve focused on the dead one. If this is done intentionally (pointing to specific examples that match the theory and ignoring examples that don\u2019t), it\u2019s called cherry-picking.", "Kids also love the LakeShore Live Steamers train rides at the Lake Metroparks Penitentiary Glen Park in Kirtland.

Right now bird flu has been infecting birds and mammals globally and spreading rapidly. very rarely it has infected humans and has not yet transferred human to human. But when it has infected humans, it's roughly a 50% survival rate. About half the people infected so far have died.  It is a matter of time before this virus mutates so that it can be transferred more easily to humans and between humans.  Seriously - this is not an if but when. \r\n\r\nAnd when that happens think about all the people who refused to wear masks in public during covid who got violent and acted out and thought covid was fake - now we have those same people who are going to hop on the conspiracy train again ever more than last time because there's ANOTHER pandemic.  Except now instead of a 1% death rate like with covid it's almost 50%.  \r\n\r\n There will still be people who have to go out in public to keep society running. Can you imagine if that was you, or someone you love knowing that if they got infected it would be a coin flip if you or they survived?  \r\n\r\nI would want our government to use every tool we had to help protect everyone I cared about, so that the people who had no choice but to use public transport and public spaces would be a little more protected and maybe not have to get sick and suffer and die because some selfish assholes who were lucky enough to not get killed by the disease value their personal liberty so much they will kill half the other people they spread the disease to.  \r\n\r\nI don't think we will have mask mandates again for covid. I think politicians talking about them now is because we have another variant and it becomes a talking point and a way to rally their base and garner support and make people mad about a problem that doesn't exist anymore. \r\n\r\n But to make this impossible to do in the future when we could have a much more deadly disease where we want every tool available to curb the spread and keep our society and economy functioning is short sighted.", "Im sorry for my hostility, tbh im in a shitty mood and seeing this shit in ohio is just depressing. I just dont want people to disregard the deaths of animals such as chickens to bird flu, yes it very well could be. But look at the reports of people in the area - chickens literally dead overnight, foxes falling ill, countless fish floating down the river dead, and civillians reporting a chemical taste in the air. The plume looks post apocalyptic and it irritates when people say its just bird flu. Just lets the corporations responsible for this hide away while people debate why animals are dying whether things are safe etc. They want people to argue and there to be confusion because then they can hide behind it.", "Eggs increasing make sense outside of inflation though. There was another round of avian flu that was breaking out so there were a lot of hens that were culled to prevent it from becoming a serious issue.
