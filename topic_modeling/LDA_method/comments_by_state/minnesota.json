We highly suspect that their samples will be positive too. \r\n\r\nWe are heartbroken at The Raptor Center to see the presumed loss of an entire great horned owl family due to HPAI and unfortunately this is not the first one we have responded to during this outbreak. Nearly every day we are admitting patients that come in suffering from the severe symptoms of HPAI.\r\n\r\nMinnesota is experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of HPAI in wild bird populations and unfortunately 90-100% of raptors who are infected will die from the disease.

It is important to remember that all bird species are susceptible to HPAI- but how they show or do not show signs of illness and the role they play in carrying and spreading the disease will vary. This virus is shed in the feces and respiratory secretions of infected birds and is very hardy, with virus particles able to survive for weeks in cool, damp environments. In wildlife, we know the most about how this virus works and presents in waterfowl, shorebirds, seabirds- as these are the groups of birds who are most likely to carry and shed the virus without showing signs of illness. We know some about how this virus impacts groups of birds like raptors, as these birds often get severely sick and rapidly die from the virus. Unfortunately, we have a lot of gaps in knowledge about the role of songbirds in HPAI outbreaks. We have some data from previous outbreaks around the world, but this outbreak is very different.

On admission to our triage hospital building, all three were suffering from extreme neurological signs and one suddenly died. Due to a high level of suffering, the remaining two youngsters were humanely euthanized and all three tested for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). Today, not only did we receive notice that the young owl samples tested positive, but we also responded to calls about two deceased adult great horned owls in the same area, presumed to be the parents. We highly suspect that their samples will be positive too. \r\n\r\nWe are heartbroken at The Raptor Center to see the presumed loss of an entire great horned owl family due to HPAI and unfortunately this is not the first one we have responded to during this outbreak. Nearly every day we are admitting patients that come in suffering from the severe symptoms of HPAI.\r\n\r\nMinnesota is experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of HPAI in wild bird populations and unfortunately 90-100% of raptors who are infected will die from the disease. The Raptor Center is doing everything possible to continue to safely receive, triage, and treat birds in need during this difficult time and our team deeply appreciates all the help and the support from the community while we do so. \r\n\r\nIf you find a raptor in need please call us at 612-624-4745 or visit our website at raptor.umn.edu\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are asking folks to remove their bird feeders and bird baths for now, so that they\u2019re able to not have a bunch of birds congregate close together.
