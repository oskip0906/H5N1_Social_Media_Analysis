You can't possibly know this for sure.", "Let me preface this by saying I don\u2019t give a shit whether people wear them or not.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m with you man but calling mask wearing during a pandemic a dystopia really detracts from your original point and makes you look nutty. Especially saying that we weren\u2019t wearing masks before for \u201cthousands of years\u201d. We also didn\u2019t use soap, antibiotics, or GPS. GPS can track you. D Y S T O P I A. We also used masks during the Spanish flu outbreak. Asia used masks during the SARS and bird flu outbreaks. \r\n\r\nI agree that people are frustrated bc the state handled this all wrong from the jump. Government inefficiency is the real dystopia. And we can\u2019t wear masks for ever, that shit is unrealistic. There is definitely a status quo made for wearing masks and I think in some cases there is over policing.\r\n\r\nBut using that word because it affects you way less as a healthy adult while others don\u2019t want old and immunocompromised people to die is over the top. My friends and family have waited weeks and months for bodies that couldn\u2019t be processed in a timely manner because of how many dead there were in the moratoriums and cemeteries. Shit was real. Not a dystopia. A reality.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it\u2019s time. People have picked their side: vaxx\u2019d or not. I think it\u2019s fine to not require masks in places that aren\u2019t medical centers or have concentrations of people with weakened immune systems. I think it\u2019s fine to allow people to not wear them as long as they aren\u2019t sick. Maybe the vax turns us all into 5G zombies, maybe the unvaccinated fuck around and find out. It is what it is now.\r\n\r\n100% of the people I see calling this a dystopia literally just don\u2019t want to wear a piece of cloth over their face rather than actually have substantive criticisms of the mandates and lockdowns. Not saying that this is or isnt the category you fall into but throwing around \u201cdystopia\u201d really sends that vibe.\r\n\r\nAlso saying you\u2019ve been here for 20 years doesn\u2019t mean anything.

The one that\u2019s always on top of my list to do when possible is the deluxe caravan Safari aka the deluxe wildlife Safari. This takes you into the multi-acre field exhibits, each broken into geographical zones. The deluxe wildlife Safari is 90 minutes along, typically will take you into East Africa and Asian savanna. You\u2019ll see white rhinos, several Antelope species ,giraffes, crowned cranes, wildebeests, and Cape buffalos in East Africa. In the Asian Savanna, you\u2019ll have Indian rhinos, banteng which are wild cattle, a few different deer species, Nilgai, and Blackbuck which are Indian antelope species that I love. \r\n\r\nI truly love that Safari tour the most and I appreciate the multi-species approach as it allows for animals to have interactions with one another in their native range. \r\n\r\nAs for other paid Safaris, the BTS tours are a solid choice as well. I\u2019ve done tours for elephants, rhinos, and Walkabout Australia. All were fun and very informative tours. They recently combined the rhinos and elephants tour into 1 so perhaps that would be a fun one to do, I plan to do it as soon as I have extra money \ud83d\ude2d\r\n\r\nAs for what you can do without paying extra, there\u2019s quite a bit and you can easily kill a few hours walking around. The exhibits I think are stellar in regards to design and animals features definitely are Lion Camp, Tiger Trail, Walkabout Australia, and Condor Ridge. Lion Camp is almost 20 years old but still regarded as one of the most impeccable lion habitats in the country. Tiger Trail is very immersive, making use of its landscape and foliage to replicate an Southeast Asian jungle for both their tigers and visitors. Walkabout Australia houses the only 2 platypuses outside their native range but can be a bit hard to spot due to the lighting, there is a marsupial walking area where kangaroos and wallabies can literally walk(or hop) in front of you. And Condor Ridge showcases the work done by the Safari Park regarding local species, with the highlight being of course the California Condors. \r\n\r\n2 of my other favorite areas are Elephant Valley and African Forest. Elephant Valley is home to 8 elephants and will soon be getting an upgrade, making is more immersive for guests and adding onto the existing area to increase their habitat as well as introducing species like waterfowl. African Forest is a criminally underrated area that is so quaint but not without its charm. It\u2019s filled with endangered birds and antelope species, very scenic but you can enjoy some quiet time from the busy crowds when you need it :) Some birds may be off exhibit due to Avian Influenza so you may see signage about it around the park. \r\n\r\nI hope you have an amazing birthday, I know I did when I first visited for my birthday 3 years ago and it\u2019s a memory I treasure always!", "All I can do is laugh and laugh and laugh and then cry at these annual Covid super spreader events. You may think you're done with the pandemic, but the pandemic is certainly not done with you.

Years ago David Change wrote an article in GQ about how his $17 bowl of ramen really ought to cost $28, but the market wasn't willing to bear that price difference, and no one would come to eat it if he charged what he really needed to to keep that dish appropriately profitable. That was maybe 10 years ago, and the truth has remained the same. A workaround, which I also agree is disingenuous and a little shady, is to start adding these fees. 3% or 5% here and there isn't so bad. But it's quickly gotten out of control especially since COVID.  \r\n  \r\nCOVID did a number on the restaurant industry as well. 4 years ago a case of eggs (180 ea), cost $40 a case. When the avian flu hit the egg producers 2 years ago, that price more than doubled. It was one of the major reasons The Nickel Diner couldn't remain open. Supply chains destroyed any predictability in getting proper goods. The EXTENSIVE limitations to styles of service and limited staff willing to work also destroyed many restaurants. All the smaller businesses lost out on the PPP loans to the larger more legally equipped counterparts.  \r\n  \r\nYes, there are bigger investor-backed restaurants that can be greedy or whatever, but I guarantee you the people who love this business, like myself, are seeing fewer and fewer opportunities for growth and sustainability. I think we're going to see a reduction in style of service, like counter service style places instead of a server coming to the table, slimmer menus with fewer unique options, and a \"blanding\" effect of the entire industry.  \r\n  \r\nWhile I agree the fees are silly and are out of control, I'm also concerned guests will get some real sticker shock when a lot of restaurants, mine included, will have to increase their prices by a noticeable amount in July, which will lead to an extreme drop in business.

Picture a long metal shed the size of a football field full of birds. Gotta vent out the shit fumes. You need artificial lighting that simulates daylight to keep production consistent through the winter. With the high density of most industrial operations you might even need actual HVAC in an area like Petaluma. \r\n\r\nYou also need feed. A lot of it. That's grain and soy, but grain prices are high because of the invasion of Ukraine. Grain prices are also high because corn or wheat are nitrogen intensive crops; natural gas is the main feedstock for nitrogen fertilizer which is also an energy intensive process to create. Then it all needs shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n$7/doz is probably high for an industrial operation but their production costs have absolutely gone up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe avian flu thing is another big part of this. Industrial meat brids are slaughtered at around 42 days. You're 3 weeks away from fertilized eggs hatching and 6 more weeks away from slaughter. Laying birds take months before they start producing. 0-5ish months is basically all cost, then 6ish-24ish months is when your birds are productive for marketable eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have to slaughter all the birds at a site when they're 14 months old you're losing your birds at peak production and you're losing them 10 months early. In 3 weeks + ~5 months you had planned on buying replacements but now you need to buy early and if you amortized costs across a bird's life you lost over half of its productive time.\r\n\r\n$7/doz may still be high because you're buying at a convenience store, but there's actually difficulties in egg production that have everything to do with production costs.", "SB Wildlife Care Network said last week there's no indication that the pelicans they have taken in have avian flu.

You name it; everything has doubled or tripled in cost. Eggs, if you can find them, have tripled in price; chicken and meat, the same. If inflation has come down, no evidence of it has appeared on the West Coast.\r\n\r\nInflation going down doesn't mean prices will go down.  That would require deflation, which can be even worse than inflation.  Inflation going down just means the rate of the price increases is falling, thus prices are still increasing, just at, you know, a slower rate.  Also, it's not like everything in the economy happens at instant speed.  The price adjustments have to work their way through the entire economy.  While prices are stabilizing for some things, other things are still catching up to the current inflated prices.  Finally, local factors can alter the prices of commodities in a particular locale.  For instance, egg prices are high because an outbreak of bird flu is causing us to cull egg-laying hen populations, so our egg prices are going to be higher for until the egg-laying hen population returns to normal levels, increasing egg supplies.  I would suspect the price of chicken would be increasing for the same reasons.", "I heard that The birds have recently been brought inside to smaller enclosures due to an outbreak of Bird flu.
