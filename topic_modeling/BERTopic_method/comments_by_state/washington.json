{"Topic 1": ["I don't know if you've been paying attention but we're kind of in the middle of a giant multi-generational societal collapse.\r\n\r\nAnd there isn't just one singular cause of it, it's multi-systemic, though a major root of the problem is \"capitalism\" and the way it sets up society in an exploitative and alienating fashion. Over the past roughly half a century or so in America, but elsewhere as well, we've seen this accelerate. There have been some partial advancements here and there, but we've also seen massive increases in inequality; massive growth of unchecked power of the wealthy and powerful; demonization of the poor and the sick; destruction of community and increasing alienation; and so on.\r\n\r\nThis whole crisis has accelerated substantially over the last decade and continues to ramp up year over year. You have massive assaults on civil liberties and free expression; on the concept of an open and inclusive society; on the very foundations of democracy. In the US we have seen this very clearly with the GOP making a long-term play to undermine democracy in multiple ways. First through the use of gerrymandering and voter suppression at the state level, then even more extreme measures culminating with a half-organized attempt to execute a coup last year. And all of this may sound far fetched and unbelievable but this is the reality of the world we live in, and it doesn't change being real just because it sounds extreme, it *is* extreme, but it's the truth. The truths of project REDMAP and of *intentional* voter suppression are well documented, even The Economist downgraded the US to a \"flawed democracy\". And this is part of a larger trend across the world, a world where democracy is a shadow of what it was and where most major world powers are controlled by aggressive extremists is very much a possibility in the next few years.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the governments and institutions that exist at present are today substantially in crisis. Many of them are crumbling or being actively deconstructed by powerful hostile forces. Many of them do not serve the public interest well, many of them are corrupt, many of them have shown that they are not up to the challenge of the present moment. In the 20th century there were many, many challenges that society faced but even though there were many failures there were also many successes. In 1900 the average American didn't have indoor plumbing or electricity, antibiotics didn't exist, and you had a pretty iffy chance of even surviving to adulthood due to the omnipresence of different diseases and environmental hazards, but there were vast improvements over the 20th century. Lately we've been coasting on those gains and ignoring the continuing work that needs to be done.\r\n\r\nToday we are faced with innumerable other crises that require enormous civilizational level investments to tackle but the elites and the powerful are largely not on board with putting in the work. We have numerous ways in which things like our land and water use and the way we grow food are not sustainable. And this has been a crisis brewing from well over a century ago. In the American Southwest water use has never been sustainable, and it's been clear that we are just operating on borrowed time. And yet despite that obviousness and the fact that the systems we put in place to manage those resources have been obviously broken and obviously corrupt for *decades* we haven't put in the work to tackle those problems. Those in power have largely been complacent, hoping that the disaster will blow up in the next generation's face instead of theirs. Well, we're finally getting to that blow up.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, hugely compounded by climate change. Another slow rolling disaster which was apparent on the horizon even in the mid-20th century but has been met consistently mostly by complacency by our power structures and governments. Which isn't to say that we haven't made some progress on it, but we haven't made anywhere near enough. Either in terms of the damage to the environment that is done by our activities or to building a society and an economy that is resilient to the inevitable damage that will result from climate change. And now those chickens are coming home to roost. We are seeing decade by decade, year by year, day by day, and hour by hour how these hypotheticals and these predictions for \"the future\" are translating into practicals for the present. We have experienced smoke season year after year in Seattle (which, illustratively, is the result of a combination of the impact of climate change making wildfires more severe and harder to control along with poor land management). Last year we had the life threatening period of the heat dome in the PNW, a story that we are now watching play out elsewhere across the globe in different areas and different times year after year (this year it's India/Pakistan and then the middle east, though now there's a crazy series of heat waves in the midwest and northeast). We've watched the looming drought develop in California and the Southwest. We've watched the record breaking floods and tornadoes and hurricanes. We recognize fully that we are in that shitty part of the post-apocalyptic movie during the starting credits where news stories are playing and explaining how the apocalypse began and we don't like that feeling at all.\r\n\r\nAnd we see the same pattern. The public is overwhelmingly onboard with dedicating sufficient resources to tackle these problems like any responsible civilization should. And yet, our government continues to do next to nothing, in stark repudiation of the public will and public *necessity*. This is not a tenable situation.\r\n\r\nThen we have the pandemic (for future readers this refers to covid-19, not bird flu or monkeypox), which has been mishandled by most governments of most developed countries. It's great that we got vaccines fairly quickly but that's not enough, what we needed was more societal support for public health. We needed people to understand that when it was necessary to do large scale lockdowns they would be married with support (in the form of food and other vital services and potentially housing as well) for the duration necessary. We needed to be able to have a society that drove down disease incidence to a level where it could then be kept under control through track and trace efforts, the way many other dangerous infectious diseases are. But we didn't get that. Instead we got a chaotic piecemeal approach that left us with a combination of years of partially enforced and partially effective restrictions and years of wave after wave after wave of disease.\r\n\r\nAnd I haven't even covered America's policing crisis. Folks have awareness of all of these things whether they understand their causes and details or not. People perceive the alienation and the hatred that has been fermented and fomented in America for decades. We live in a culture that produces suicide murderers as a casual byproduct. These are just an everyday occurrence in America which don't even ping the radar unless more than a handful of people die. Our society is sick on a grand scale, and these are the obvious symptoms of it. Individually we might be able to protect ourselves against this sickness through robust support networks made up of our friends, family, coworkers, maybe our personal wealth, etc, but for those without such physical or interpersonal resources to fall back on there is no protection from the reality that we live in a harsh dehumanizing hellscape.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, all of these vast global level crises (the climate disaster, the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the threat of WW3, etc.) causes people to think more deeply about value and meaning in their own lives. They step back and realize that they have substantially been abused and misused by society and specifically by our economic system. We work in demoralizing jobs that give us limited autonomy and limited slivers of time in which to be ourselves and to properly live. And we don't like it. We wonder \"what's the fucking point of spending all this time working for others just to pay rent and feed ourselves when the apocalypse is looming\". And that forces us to re-evaluate the value of everything we do or are forced to do regardless of how closely the threat of death and destruction looms, because everyone of us will die eventually, and whether that's next year or a few decades away the question of how we spend that precious coin of the time we have to live is still critically important. Increasingly people have been unsatisfied not just with how they are spending their time but more so with the options given to them. It used to be that it was much easier to make some sacrifices in terms of your standard of living to open up opportunities for making big changes in your life (going to school to change careers or pursuing personal projects or simply giving yourself more free time and more autonomy by living more humbly) but slowly year by year those opportunities have been swept away and lost for average folks. Increasingly people have gotten locked into lives they have limited control over. You can't change careers or take a break because you're saddled with student loan debt or high rent. And increasingly people end up stuck in lives where they just wonder what the point of even existing is. When you see horrors happening routinely (race massacres in US cities, crimes against humanity in Ukraine, the climate apocalypse looming, the rollback of civil rights, a million Americans dead from covid, etc.) you really start to question the value of the life you're living right now and what it even means to live a rewarding life and you start to wonder how doing so in the near-future is going to even be possible for you and your loved ones.\r\n\r\nPlus it's been extra gloomy in Seattle far later in the year than normal, and that always lowers people's spirits a little.", "They gassed like 50 million chickens and turkeys this month for bird flu, are the thinking people going to attend to that?", "Chicken prices are up something like 30% since the first of the year due to bird flu killing 100+ million chickens in the US alone.", "Bird flu is leading to farmers having to kill tens of thousands of birds so Chicken is going to be expensive for quite a while", "Bird Flu is causing prices to rise.", "You have to be aware there is a bird flu epidemic that is killing entire flocks of chickens.

Your local stranding network volunteer here! I figured since this post has gotten pretty popular, I should chime in :) \r\n\r\nSo in a situation like this, the best thing to do would be to get out of the water and away from the animal. It may just be curious, it could be feeling territorial, but regardless of the motives of the seal (and those big puppy dog eyes luring you in for a cuddle) it\u2019s still a wild animal weighing anywhere from 200-300lbs, 5-6\u2019 long, armed with sharp teeth and sharp claws on it\u2019s flippers, and an infinitely better swimmer than you could ever hope to be.

However, it has a high mutation rate as all flu strains do, as well as being subject to standard flu strain creation mechanisms. So the worry that a strain which is as transmissible person to person as typical human flu strains are is a serious potentiality. So far this strain has a roughly 30-80% case fatality rate in humans, which is, uh, let's call it eye opening, though there's a lot of variables involved.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that the potential for a highly transmissible in humans strain of avian influenza definitely exists and could hit the world with a pandemic problem that would make covid-19 look like a walk in the park. On top of that it's devastating many bird populations and has likely already been a major factor in the extinction of some endangered bird species. Especially it has had and will continue to have a major impact on the poultry business, which just adds to the whole mess of food production and availability that's going on globally right now. And to add to that there's the even worse news that because of the nature of how immunity is acquired for the flu as well as the rapid evolution of flu viruses vaccines just aren't terribly good.\r\n\r\nIf you asked an infectious disease expert in, say, 2018 what they were worried about in terms of the next pandemic in humans they would have told you the flu, specifically the H5N1 strain, but we ended up getting hit by a different bullet, this time.\r\n\r\nIf you've got a sinking feeling in your gut now, here comes the good news. In the last few years education and control efforts have reduced the number of human cases of H5N1 from a high of dozens of cases per year in the early 2010s to just a handful a year in the late 2010s and then to incredibly isolated incidents in the last few years. Also, spread of the flu is highly controllable by wearing a mask in public, limiting exposure, and washing your hands. Such measures are much more effective against the flu than covid, so much so that the precautions over the last two years may have resulted in a few previously circulating flu strains to go extinct. So there are effective means of control if a deadly flu strain did pop up.", "Evolution takes time. Bird flu for example was first discovered in the late 1800s and likely existed for longer but didn't make the jump to humans until 1997. I'm not saying it is or isn't covid, just that it could make sense that a virus we've only seen in one species that's newer could only just now be making the jump to another resulting in a completely unknown deadly disease.", "I don\u2019t know.  Although animals experiencing the H5N1 avian flu disease for the past two years are definitely in a global flu pandemic.  Fingers crossed it doesn\u2019t jump to us.\r\n\r\nThe main difference between flu and Covid is that in an average year flu kills about 386,000 people globally.      \r\nAveraged over the past 3 years, Covid has killed 8,000,000 around the world *annually*.  So it\u2019s an order of magnitude more deadly.  \r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s not counting the [65 million+](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2) (*as of last January*) around the world who have long-Covid.", "&gt; Do you have sources for this? That case fatality rate is extreme!\r\n\r\nStats are on wikipedia (with sources): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1#Transmission_and_host_range\r\n\r\nThe cases are kind of all over the place so it's very hard to generalize case fatality rates, especially as the cases range over a huge diversity of countries in terms of economic and development levels. But overall fatality rates are shockingly high.\r\n\r\n&gt; &gt; \"...as well as the rapid evolution of flu viruses vaccines just aren't terribly good.\"\r\n\r\n&gt; Agreed. Due to the rate of antigentic variation, right?\r\n\r\nPartly, but it's actually much worse than that due to quirks in the human immune system which are aggravated with the flu. There's a phenomenon which has been given the name [original antigenic sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin) which basically results in your immune system plowing whatever furrow it previously did when it comes to tackling a particular disease or even set of diseases (though there's a lot of complexities here I'm glossing over for simplicity's sake). And this can lead to weak immunity depending on differences between the strain you first acquired immunity against and a later strain. For the flu what happens is that you end up with stronger immunity against the type of flu strain you were first exposed to, and weak immunity to certain other variations. Because your immune system can't \"lose\" against the inactivated flu virus in the vaccine it's not going to learn that it's weak immunity against a particular strain wasn't enough, it's just going to intensify that weak immunity rather than switch antigenic targets to something more effective.\r\n\r\nIn short this means that there can be a limit to how effective a flu vaccine can be for a given individual when the vaccine is based off of live or dead viruses. And this could be a reason why seasonal flu vaccines are usually only modestly effective on average. However, this might be more controllable with the magic of mRNA vaccines and other advanced vaccine technologies, but we are only just beginning to put in the work there and it may take years to pay off.\r\n\r\nSo the other good news is that potentially within the next couple of years we could see some highly effective mRNA based universal flu vaccines introduced, and these could be broadly protective against seasonal flu and new pandemic flu strains that might pop up, including H5N1 variants.", "Maybe read YOU OWN FUCKING LINK before correcting someone:\r\n\r\n&gt;Examples of **different influenza A virus subtypes** currently endemic in animals include H1N1 and H3N2 in pigs (different strains than those found in humans), H3N8 in horses, H3N2 in dogs, and H5N1 in wild water birds and domestic poultry.", "[WHO report - 18 January 2023](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2023-DON434)\r\n\r\n&gt; \"This is the first reported case of human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5) virus in the Latin America and the Caribbean region.
