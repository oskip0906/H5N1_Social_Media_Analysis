Our birthing nurse was amazing. Born in an ice storm, so she stayed quite awhile. After she left it all went to shit. Every other nurse was competing either for the beeotch-supreme award or the biggest shoulder shrug trophy. Granted it was our first time, but lactation difficulties, and a collicky baby left us needing some help. They just kept repeating \"have you tried feeding him?\". Yes, yes, and four more times after that, yes. Never once offered supplementary formula. Never once offered anything besides have you tried feeding him and/or shoulder shrugs. Literal f'ing shoulder shrugs. It didnt get any better until our peditrician showed up and started bossing nurses around. Baby lost more weight than it should have...but why not, he was starving...our fault of course...why you ask? ...*shoulder shrug*\n\nSide note -  Before baby #2 we did a pre visit at St lukes and Mercy. They were so beeotchy during the visit it was clear how it was going to go so we went with Mercy. This all happened during some lame lesser bird flu outbreak in Canada or some such nonsense so all birth suites regardless of hospital were saying no more than 2 'visitors'. A buddy of mine had a baby at St lukes during that time. Grandparents came for a visit, he went out to the waiting room to get them...they wouldnt let all 3 go back...Dad isnt dad, he is a visitor. Stupid, but fine. He tried to wait in the waiting room, hospital staff said he couldnt wait in building, had to go outside. Dude was wearing panjama bottoms and a tshirt - it was dead of winter. Asked if he could get his coat? Nope, leave before we call security. Doesnt want to cause trouble, stands outside as close to door as possible so he can catch a little warmth. Security comes out and makes him stand on the far side of the driveway. So he cant cantaminate the building he was just in. He got wise real quick...bundled up and put a lawn chair outside the suite window so he could still be part of the experience and see his parents see the baby for the first time and such. Meanwhile, Mercy at that time counted Dad as dad and I got to be in the room even with 2 visitors :)\n\nMercy - 2 babies, amazing experiences with both. Dad got treated like a human being instead of a nuisance. Mom got taken care of very well - still a little trouble lactating? How about we try some supplementary formula! Oh snap - baby was past birth weight when we left, everyone got more sleep, not one single nurse shrugged at me...not one! Every time there was a question there was an answer or an attempt to find an answer! Food was indeed good. Couldnt have been happier with Mercy and had 2 children there!\n\n...wife decided along the way that she wanted to try all-natural, and wanted to use a mid-wife program instead of the ob-gyn. So, the next 3...\n\nUofI (midwife program) - efficient, we were driving a bit and waited too long. Baby #5 came out 4 minutes after arrival, no one but the closest nurse in the room...still went just fine :) Overall, I would compare as very close to Mercy...slightly more clinical astetics, Mercy was more cozy, but otherwise fine. UofI is a research hospital, so they will ask for permission to bring students in and allow them to do rudimentary tasks and check ups after the birth.
