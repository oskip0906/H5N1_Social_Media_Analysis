Hopefully someone knows, because this should be checked out, even if it turns out to be nothing to worry about (like flying into windows or something)", "Confirmed bird flu in our area. NJ has confirmed cases of this atleast I\u2019m sure it\u2019s in Philly as well", "My dad has been in Abington's ER for almost 48 hours now. Docs keep saying they're gonna admit him and take him upstairs, but the inn is still full I guess. \r\n\r\nWear your masks, influenza A (aka Bird Flu) is apparently kicking the region's ass right now."], "Topic 15": ["H5N1 is killing birds and other wildlife all over the world. Keep your cats and dogs away. I\u2019ve seen news articles about both getting H5N1 from sick birds and dying. It also has like a 50% mortality rate in humans if you manage to get it. So don\u2019t touch the dead birds.", "Ugh yes h5n1 has also been on my radar. Have you seen a lot of dead birds around Erie?  Masking is such an easy thing to do to mitigate the spread of many different diseases, I hate that it became politicized instead of normalized.", "Ugh that\u2019s really concerning. Is anyone monitoring the wildlife around here in any capacity to determine if h5n1 is the cause?  \r\n\r\nYeah I am in the same boat. I just mind my own business and leave people alone and that is generally reciprocated. I\u2019ve only been bothered about masking once and I wasn\u2019t even in Erie when it happened. People here don\u2019t seem to care too much, but I also don\u2019t take go many places to test that out haha"], "Topic 16": ["See if you can find a local farmer. The giant aggro corps have been hit hard by the bird flu", "you may not want to do a feeder during this Bird Flu pandemic."]}
