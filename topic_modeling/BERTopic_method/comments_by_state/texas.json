When I went to Taipei two years ago (right before the world as I knew it then ended), the airport had signs specifically regarding pork products as you were coming through customs, primarily regarding regions where African swine fever was known to be present.  Pretty much any developed country is going to heavily scrutinize organic materials, especially when they involve meats (because of ASF, Avian Flu or Mad Cow Disease) or unprocessed plants.

Also, if you are actively avoiding handling and consuming raw OR undercooked beef, eggs, chicken, milk, cheese, etc, your risk is extremely low.\n\nFrom my understanding, the virus has not reached human to human transmission. All confirmed human infections are from people who interacted with sick/infected animals/spaces.\n\nThe virus does need to go through certain mutations to be able to become human to human transmissible.\n\nONE of these mutations has been confirmed, but it needs to go through multiple mutations.\n\nIF the virus is detected in pigs, these mutations become more likely and the risk becomes greater.\n\nOther animals interacting with infected farm animals have fallen ill with quite severe symptoms and have died, including farm cats as well as a domestic NON farm cat, so the virus may be spreading to other cats outside of these farms.\n\nOwners should keep their cats indoors, and also make sure their dogs don't try to lick/eat bird poop or raw/undercooked beef/eggs/dairy(if you feed your pet a raw/freeze dried diet, this is a legitimate concern).\n\nThe CDC has highly recommended farm workers wear appropriate PPE, but they essentially said the CDC can f\u2022ck off and that they won't take extra necessary precautions.\n\nBut, as of right now, in this moment and stage of the virus, I wouldn't be too concerned if you're being careful about what you and your pets consume. Maybe also avoid spending time with any friends or family that actively work on at risk farms if you want to be extra extra extra cautious. This would be moreso due to if they have virus particles on their person from farm animal feces/fluids that you could pick up, not so much about any human to human transmission risk.\n\nAdditionally, the appropriate entities have stated that an adequate vaccine specifically for H5N1 could be created in a matter of weeks with an expedited rollout in the event that it does become human to human.\n\nThe greatest risk is in those early weeks/months before people can get vaccinated, so at the earliest confirmation of any human to human spread, just make some life changes and be extra careful(we all know how different people will handle this stage based on the Covid pandemic).", "It is raging through farms but we don't know what the human version will look like: infectivity rate and a whole host of other factors. COVID was quite unique in its infectivity rate and the nature of its asymptomatic spread. In retrospect, it was impossible to contain.\n\nOther outbreaks have occurred where the infectivity rate is low and you can only transmit when symptoms are showing. The diseases are still difficult to contain, but we do a much better job. Swine Flu raged a couple years ago.. it was bad, but nowhere near as bad as COVID.\n\nWith H5N1, we have some vaccines, therapeutics and tests. As I understand it, the Flu A tests works on H5N1.

So, the \u201cflu\u201d refers to a group of viruses that are genetically related, but are not all identical. In fact, there are hundreds of different viruses that can cause the flu! There are a few hundred different breeds of dogs, so you can think of it like that - a dog is a dog, but there are hundreds of different kinds with distinct features, and there are also tons of possibilities of genetic mashups to make mutts. We can group dogs into categories; for example, large, medium, and small, or we could group them by function like tracking or hunting or novelty or whatever. You get the idea. We do the same with flu viruses; categorize them into functional groups. That\u2019s why you might hear things like Flu A versus Flu B, or you might hear someone mention the H5N1 group versus H1N1, for example. \n\nNow, every year a group of smart, appropriately-educated and experienced folks use sophisticated computer algorithms to predict which of the hundreds of different strains of flu are likely to be the most prevalent in the upcoming season. Any given vaccine can only contain antigens from maybe four different strains of the flu (\u201cantigen\u201d is what we call an identifier that your immune system can use to recognize the virus; think of it like being given a photo of a chihuahua so you could later recognize that breed of dog if you saw one at the park). So each year the experts say, what are the four strains of flu that we are most worried about? Which are the top viruses that could make the most people sick this year, or that could cause the most harm in infected individuals? Once those have been identified, they are packaged up into a vaccine. \n\nThe vaccine is very effective at preventing illness from those four top flu viruses. But, again, there are hundreds of flu viruses! Just like dogs though, some breeds are very similar to each other, so the flu vaccine can also be protective for many other strains that happen to be similar to the four included in the shot. And there are even more strains that are not similar enough for the vaccine to prevent disease; however, they are juuust similar enough for your body to go, \u201chmm, this seems familiar, I think I know what to do here!\u201d and the illness is relatively mild or short. \n\nPlus, if you get a flu shot every year, then every year your body is learning about new variations of the flu. Even if the flu shot \u201cwears off\u201d after a while, your body at least has that experience under its belt, and in the future if you\u2019re exposed to a variation of the virus that you were vaccinated for several years ago, you might get sick, but it may still be more mild than it would have been if you weren\u2019t getting vaccinated. \n\nHowever, here\u2019s the thing. There are still hundreds of these little suckers and every now and then, you\u2019re going to encounter one that is totally new to your body, or is just some kind of mutt of a virus that your immune system doesn\u2019t quickly recognize. If you don\u2019t get vaccinated regularly, this is more likely to occur, but it can happen to anyone. When it happens, you get sick with the flu. Sometimes really sick. And it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you got your flu shot that particular year, because this virus is not one of the ones in the vaccine. It\u2019s a random troll you picked up somewhere, and it\u2019s going to take your body a while to mount a specified immune response and figure out the best way to get rid of it. And that is how, even after receiving the flu shot, you can still get the worst flu of your life. But it\u2019s also the reason why you *should* get the flu shot every single year, to lessen the chances you will encounter a strain totally foreign to your immune system.", "&gt;Covid? Bird flu?

H5N1 highly pathogenic avian flu is highly mutable and often described as \"the big one\" by virologists and epidemiologists. Covid is referred to as \"preparedness practice\" for a H5N1 human pandemic.  I feel relieved that many countries are alert, have been historically prepared or beginning to prepare.

In 2009, we actually used that plan in response to H1N1, when [**the swine flu came to fruition in Cibolo**](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103744903), and refined it, made it more of an influenza plan. We\u2019ve continued to revise it, and it\u2019s been a part of our preparedness plan at H-E-B ever since.\u00a0 \n\n**Craig Boyan, president, H-E-B:** Justen leads our emergency preparedness with a group of folks, and that is a full-time, year-round position. We are constantly in a year-round state of preparedness for different emergencies. We keep emergency supplies at almost every warehouse and have water and other supplies staged and ready to go and kept in storage to make sure that we are ready to \\[react quickly\\] when a crisis emerges, whether it be a hurricane or a pandemic. We take being a strong emergency responder in Texas, to take care of Texas communities, very seriously.\u00a0 \n\n**Tina James,** **chief people officer, H-E-B:** For example, when we saw what was happening with the volume, we asked at corporate if people wanted to volunteer to take shifts in the stores and at the warehouses. We immediately had hundreds\u2014800 corporate folks volunteered for 350, 400 shifts in our stores and warehouses, to be able to help out and give some relief to our stores.\u00a0\n\n**Stephanie Lowe, customer**: I met Alma, who has been with H-E-B for 21 years, if I recall, and works in the store\u2019s bookkeeping department. She had answered the \u201call hands on deck\u201d call and was working checkout for the first time in years and she was so excited.
