I\u2019m not calling you a conspiracy theorist, I don\u2019t know you and I don\u2019t know how serious you are about this idea. But I like breaking down this kind of thing\u2026\r\n\r\n\u201cI found a dead bird in my yard. There are no apparent injuries, so the explanation isn\u2019t obvious.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with this as an observation by itself, but the next step before adopting any explanation would be to come up with a testable hypothesis. \u201cI don\u2019t see another explanation\u201d is not the same thing as \u201cthere is no other explanation.\u201d It\u2019s called an argument from ignorance fallacy: I don\u2019t know any other explanation, so I\u2019ve adopted this one. \r\n\r\n\u201cThere are harmful chemicals in the air due to the East Palestine incident. Last night it rained and now there\u2019s a dead bird. Could it be related?\u201d\r\n\r\nAgain, as a question, there\u2019s nothing fundamentally wrong with asking this. But a suggested explanation shouldn\u2019t be adopted without clear evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s possible\u201d is not the same thing as \u201cit\u2019s actual.\u201d Plus, one would need to demonstrate that a specific explanation is even possible before offering it. Has it been demonstrated to be possible for chemicals to travel from East Palestine to Dayton through clouds and rain? If it\u2019s not shown to be possible, it\u2019s not a candidate explanation. \r\n\r\nAnd correlation is not causation. \u201cMy rooster crowed this morning and the sun came up. My rooster must have caused the sunrise!\u201d Two things happening near each other doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a causal link. \r\n\r\nFurther, we have a single dead bird being floated as a possible pattern. We haven\u2019t established a pattern yet, but let\u2019s say we did. Let\u2019s say more dead birds are found\u2026 maybe 5, maybe 10, maybe 1000. Maybe every single bird in Ohio drops out of the sky and dies. We would still need evidence to demonstrate a link between the events in East Palestine and the death of the birds. Simply assuming or asserting a connection is not sufficient, it must be demonstrated. \r\n\r\nMaybe, as another commenter pointed out, it\u2019s avian flu. Maybe there are toxic chemicals in the air from the train derailment AND there\u2019s also something else killing birds. Both could be true. Conspiracy thinking tends to adopt a simple explanation quickly, without considering all options. (Simple meaning satisfying to the person; it doesn\u2019t mean conspiracy theories can\u2019t be complex or complicated. Look at the various features included in OP\u2019s potential explanation)\r\n\r\nConspiracy thinkers also fixate on anomalies. They focus on specific details which stand out or don\u2019t seem to fit, while sometimes ignoring or missing other data. There may be hundreds of living birds flying around OP\u2019s house, but they\u2019ve focused on the dead one.
