The avian flu was very bad recently which wiped out major chicken suppliers. If avian flu is detected in one of your birds you have to dispose all of them\u2026.think thousands of birds. That not only decreases the amount of chicken available but eggs as well", "Farmers get tax breaks and such, but the industry is setting farmers up for failure. I\u2019ll provide a link to an article that highlights common struggles in dairy farming, but there are issues in other segments of farming as well. Plant based large-scale farmers are typically under contract to purchase specific seed, and the seed is usually modified so they aren\u2019t able to save seed from harvest to replant, meaning they always have to buy seed; oftentimes crops are grown in soils that are exhausted due to industrial farming, so they also are forced to purchase fertilizer; with the changing weather patterns, after these expenses sometimes crops even fail and then they make no money. In a lot of situations, farmers get very little profit off of their goods, which puts them in a cycle of debt and poverty, like the article states about the family owing hundreds of thousands of dollars on used farm equipment. There are tons of facets. I mean, some farmers now have to kill their entire flocks of chickens because of avian flu, that\u2019s a huge financial loss. In summary I think industrial farming just isn\u2019t working for our changing climate and for our consumer system that\u2019s screwing not only the farmer, but the land. Here\u2019s the article, but feel free to google a bit more and find more info for non-dairy farmers - it\u2019s rampant and has kept me away from my dream idea of owning a farm. \r\n\r\nhttps://time.com/5736789/small-american-farmers-debt-crisis-extinction/", "Well, food scarcity is just going to get worse. The weather, war etc this year has damaged crops. Also a lot of cows have started to be culled or have died bc bird flu, but also cows produce less milk when they have bird flu, so it follows that dairy products are scarce. I\u2019m not sure which farm, but one in Michigan killed 10% of their cows.\u00a0"], "Topic 11": ["In the US there have been no known transmissions of HPAI to humans yet.
