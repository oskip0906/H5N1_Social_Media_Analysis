The one that\u2019s always on top of my list to do when possible is the deluxe caravan Safari aka the deluxe wildlife Safari. This takes you into the multi-acre field exhibits, each broken into geographical zones. The deluxe wildlife Safari is 90 minutes along, typically will take you into East Africa and Asian savanna. You\u2019ll see white rhinos, several Antelope species ,giraffes, crowned cranes, wildebeests, and Cape buffalos in East Africa. In the Asian Savanna, you\u2019ll have Indian rhinos, banteng which are wild cattle, a few different deer species, Nilgai, and Blackbuck which are Indian antelope species that I love. \r\n\r\nI truly love that Safari tour the most and I appreciate the multi-species approach as it allows for animals to have interactions with one another in their native range. \r\n\r\nAs for other paid Safaris, the BTS tours are a solid choice as well. I\u2019ve done tours for elephants, rhinos, and Walkabout Australia. All were fun and very informative tours. They recently combined the rhinos and elephants tour into 1 so perhaps that would be a fun one to do, I plan to do it as soon as I have extra money \ud83d\ude2d\r\n\r\nAs for what you can do without paying extra, there\u2019s quite a bit and you can easily kill a few hours walking around. The exhibits I think are stellar in regards to design and animals features definitely are Lion Camp, Tiger Trail, Walkabout Australia, and Condor Ridge. Lion Camp is almost 20 years old but still regarded as one of the most impeccable lion habitats in the country. Tiger Trail is very immersive, making use of its landscape and foliage to replicate an Southeast Asian jungle for both their tigers and visitors. Walkabout Australia houses the only 2 platypuses outside their native range but can be a bit hard to spot due to the lighting, there is a marsupial walking area where kangaroos and wallabies can literally walk(or hop) in front of you. And Condor Ridge showcases the work done by the Safari Park regarding local species, with the highlight being of course the California Condors. \r\n\r\n2 of my other favorite areas are Elephant Valley and African Forest. Elephant Valley is home to 8 elephants and will soon be getting an upgrade, making is more immersive for guests and adding onto the existing area to increase their habitat as well as introducing species like waterfowl. African Forest is a criminally underrated area that is so quaint but not without its charm. It\u2019s filled with endangered birds and antelope species, very scenic but you can enjoy some quiet time from the busy crowds when you need it :) Some birds may be off exhibit due to Avian Influenza so you may see signage about it around the park. \r\n\r\nI hope you have an amazing birthday, I know I did when I first visited for my birthday 3 years ago and it\u2019s a memory I treasure always!", "&gt; \r\n&gt; Six birds in Orange County have tested positive for avian flu, according to the county\u2019s Health Care Agency.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \u201cAvian flu is present in Orange County and while the risk of transmission to humans is low, residents should stay away from any dead birds,\u201d Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county\u2019s public health officer, said in [an advisory](https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/oc-health-care-agency-reports-avian-flu-confirmed-orange-county-birds). \u201cBird flu is very contagious among birds and can sicken and even kill certain domesticated bird species including chickens, ducks and turkeys.\u201d\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Authorities advise people and their pets to avoid wild birds \u2014 whether dead or alive \u2014 and surfaces that may be contaminated with bird saliva or feces.

That would require deflation, which can be even worse than inflation.  Inflation going down just means the rate of the price increases is falling, thus prices are still increasing, just at, you know, a slower rate.  Also, it's not like everything in the economy happens at instant speed.  The price adjustments have to work their way through the entire economy.  While prices are stabilizing for some things, other things are still catching up to the current inflated prices.  Finally, local factors can alter the prices of commodities in a particular locale.  For instance, egg prices are high because an outbreak of bird flu is causing us to cull egg-laying hen populations, so our egg prices are going to be higher for until the egg-laying hen population returns to normal levels, increasing egg supplies.  I would suspect the price of chicken would be increasing for the same reasons.", "Well talk about infuriating! I just saw that there\u2019s like 500+ comments on CPUC webpage. I\u2019m not opposed to price increases if it makes sense but I am furious about this. The cost of natural gas is down AND I doubt any of the workers or employees get any time of raise per year.\r\n\r\nLike the cost of eggs right now. It\u2019s miserable and sucks but I get that demand is low due to the avian flu. I can respect that, this stunt with Socal gas is straight greed.", "https://www.axios.com/2023/05/18/once-a-fringe-theory-greedflation-gets-its-due\r\n\r\nI'm not making this up. Economists are finally catching up to reality. Prices are high *just because.*\r\n\r\n&gt;It\u2019s clear a supply shortage bc avian flu caused prices to spike.\r\n\r\nThere was a small supply change (something like 45 million chickens died), but there are *a lot* of chickens in America. *Ten billion* chickens almost. So that's less than half a percent of all the chickens in America. Does that sound like a reason the price should increase by 200%? Especially at the company in my article, which lost *zero chickens?*", "You really dont understand chemistry and the refining process do you.... Gasoline and Diesel are made from the same general product, Crude Oil. Gasoline and Diesel are made at different temperatures, have different chemical compositions as well as different specific gravities. There are 2 distinct methods to make Gasoline and Diesel, they are just made with the same natural product, Crude Oil.\r\n\r\nThe reason Diesel prices are higher than gas prices is because (partially) due to demand. Gasoline is used more in the US versus Diesel. Therefore, Oil/Gas companies make less Diesel than Gasoline and therefore prices go slightly higher as there is less supply.\r\n\r\nYou also dont understand how supply and demand work. There is a limited amount of supply of Natural Gas (not a derivative of Crude Oil, this is something different). The local Gas company has to buy this from Oil/Gas companies who are charging this higher rate. The local gas company is then delivering these increases to us. To be fair, the local Gas Companies were very transparent in the fact that temporary price increases were coming.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is currently happening with Eggs. Supply is significantly down due to Avian Flu. So prices go up. It sucks but nothing we can do about it....\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\nWhile there may be some price gouging, specifically by the oil companies, Supply is way down. And that is always going to cause price increases. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do. The government back in the day decided to make utilities privatized and the consumers have been suffering for years because of this. If utilities were still run by the government, we definitely wouldnt be seeing this stuff occuring, but who knows what other problems may have come because of that (i.e. slow response times, corrupton, etc.)\r\n\r\n&amp;#x200B;\r\n\r\nSource: Chemical Engineer who used to work in the Oil Fields in Unitah and D-J Basin", "It's because restaurant owners are worried that the market isn't ready for the actual cost of food. Years ago David Change wrote an article in GQ about how his $17 bowl of ramen really ought to cost $28, but the market wasn't willing to bear that price difference, and no one would come to eat it if he charged what he really needed to to keep that dish appropriately profitable. That was maybe 10 years ago, and the truth has remained the same. A workaround, which I also agree is disingenuous and a little shady, is to start adding these fees. 3% or 5% here and there isn't so bad. But it's quickly gotten out of control especially since COVID.  \r\n  \r\nCOVID did a number on the restaurant industry as well. 4 years ago a case of eggs (180 ea), cost $40 a case. When the avian flu hit the egg producers 2 years ago, that price more than doubled. It was one of the major reasons The Nickel Diner couldn't remain open. Supply chains destroyed any predictability in getting proper goods. The EXTENSIVE limitations to styles of service and limited staff willing to work also destroyed many restaurants. All the smaller businesses lost out on the PPP loans to the larger more legally equipped counterparts.  \r\n  \r\nYes, there are bigger investor-backed restaurants that can be greedy or whatever, but I guarantee you the people who love this business, like myself, are seeing fewer and fewer opportunities for growth and sustainability. I think we're going to see a reduction in style of service, like counter service style places instead of a server coming to the table, slimmer menus with fewer unique options, and a \"blanding\" effect of the entire industry.  \r\n  \r\nWhile I agree the fees are silly and are out of control, I'm also concerned guests will get some real sticker shock when a lot of restaurants, mine included, will have to increase their prices by a noticeable amount in July, which will lead to an extreme drop in business. LA is not doing the once thriving and beautifully diverse diaspora of small business owned restaurants any favors.", "Nah dude. Egg producers are making record profits. Eggs bought/sold for the public are also increasing at a higher rate than wholesale (like at restaurants). This is one indicator that there's gouging going on, partially based on real stuff affecting the market (supply chain, avian flu), but it seems like they're taking advantage of this situation to drive up prices as much as possible. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/politicians-advocacy-groups-call-ftc-investigation-egg-price-gouging-2023-1", "I have done some research which is why I took issue with this comment.

Factory shutdowns over the last few years have also led to a scarcity of goods across the globe, we can ease this by opening factories in America which no one is talking about. The list goes on and on and billionaires are convenient scapegoats because no one wants to actually force our government to tackle the problem.
