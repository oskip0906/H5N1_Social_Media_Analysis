So current HPAI is not easily transmissible between humans, but if someone catches it from, say, working at a chicken farm, or handling a wild carcass as a good samaritan trying to clean up, and either already has or shortly after catches the standard seasonal flu shit can get real fucky, REAL quick.\r\n\r\nIt's known as antigenic shift, it's rare but it's what caused the swine flu outbreak in humans back in 2009.
