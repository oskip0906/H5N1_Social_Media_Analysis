State animal health officials have quarantined the property in southern Wisconsin's Jefferson County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Milwaukee. All chickens in the flock will be destroyed and will not enter the food system, the USDA said.

Farms that raise turkeys and chickens for consumption have been on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity since avian influenza was recently discovered in a handful of states, including Indiana and Iowa. **Producers fear a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak in 2015 that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion**.

Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can spread from flock to flock by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.",2022-03-15 08:04:44,madisonwi,Fear,0.9997187256813048

This hardware cloth (steel) is buried about 1 foot into the ground around the run to discourage animals from digging under the fence/ This means wild birds cannot get in and share space / food with the chickens which greatly reduces risk of avian flu transmission.

"Well, because mosquitos are a very important part of the overall ecosystem. 

Mosquitos, and other biting insects, including bedbugs, Black Flies and fleas (among others), is how Nature takes energy from the top of the food change and sends it back down to the bottom. Upthread, folks were celebrating frogs, toads and dragonflies for their Mosquito-eating prowess. Guess what happens to those happy warriors when there are no more mosquitos? 

There are fewer frogs, toads, dragonflies, damselflies, salamanders, spiders and a host of other useful critters. And fewer of the critters that eat those useful critters (spiders get a double whammy here). 

Which will throw things quite out of whack. Other species that aren't mosquitos, which hatch in big bunches during specific parts of the year, will benefit greatly, because their predators, deprived of a regular diet of reliable mosquitos, will be few and far between. Their population will boom! Friendly critters like ticks, earwigs, crickets and others. 

Also, the bigger critters that eat frogs, toads, dragonflies, damselflies, salamanders, spiders and the host of other mosquito predators will also suffer. Fish, birds, snakes, and other forest dwellers. 

I approve of trying to reduce populations of disease-causing mosquitos. And also use Skeeter Dunks in standing water around my house. I further approve of efforts to eliminate invasive species of mosquitoes that are devastating rare bird species in Hawaii by spreading Avian Flu. 

But, overall, the little bastards are an important part of the natural balance. So I guess I'll resign myself to keep swatting the ones who are trying to suck my personal energy back down the foodchain, and think about the Circle of Life.",2024-06-16 11:44:25,madisonwi,Joy,0.9998745918273926

""It may seem counterintuitive that egg and chicken prices moved in opposite directions.
The dynamic is primarily due to a severe outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. — which has killed many egg-laying hens but has largely left chickens raised for meat production unscathed, according to economists.

Chickens raised for meat consumption — known as ""broilers"" — aren't affected by avian flu to the same extent as the ""layers.""
""It's two totally different styles of production, two totally different breeds of bird,"" Moscogiuri said.
The life cycle of a broiler is much shorter — anywhere from 5.5 to 9 weeks, from hatch to slaughter, according to Vencomatic Group, a poultry consulting firm.

However, the life cycle for an egg-laying hen can be upwards of 100 weeks, Moscogiuri said. It can take about five to six months for layers just to reach full productivity, according to the Agriculture Department.
The latter are therefore more susceptible to bird flu since farmers must keep them alive for a longer time, experts said.
Broiler quantity is also up, contributing to lower chicken prices at the grocery store.""",2023-04-04 19:10:33,minnesota,Sadness,0.8691375255584717

"&gt;Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed in two poultry flocks in Minnesota, the state Board of Animal Health announced Saturday.

&gt;The agency said the affected poultry flocks are a commercial flock of nearly 300,000 turkeys in Meeker County, and a backyard flock of 17 chickens, ducks and geese in Mower County. Samples collected from both flocks were tested on March 25 and confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

&gt;The state Board of Animal Health said they're the first confirmed cases in Minnesota in 2022.

&gt;Back in 2015, 9 million birds in Minnesota were killed by the virus, or euthanized to slow its spread. The virus is believed to be spread by migrating waterfowl in the spring.

&gt;Poultry producers in the state had been on high alert for weeks, and taking steps to increase biosecurity, after the virus was detected in neighboring states, including Iowa and South Dakota.

&gt;Officials cautioned that the appearance of avian flu in a backyard flock is a key difference from the 2015 outbreak.

&gt;""We are prepared to make sure this outbreak stays small,” said Dr. Jill Nezworski, a poultry veterinarian and a board member of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. “And I want to remind all poultry owners that biosecurity takes 100 percent commitment, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.""

Seems that's likely the data used in the infographic. They shopped prices before stores started the steep discounting. The reality is that most stores are losing money on the turkey this week, while hoping to make it up by selling you all the fixings. For instance, that $1.99 box of Stove Top Stuffing at Cub, on sale right now, is frequently on sale for 99¢ at other times throughout the year, so even on sale now they're making a nice cut there.

Average Thanksgiving meal costs are up 20% but it still doesn't seem that crazy. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual Thanksgiving dinner cost survey, the average cost is $64.05 this year to feed 10 people. That's just over $1 more per person. With fuel prices what they are, seems that driving to another store would negate some of that savings. More so, the time and energy wouldn't be worth it for many.

Even if the chickens that were culled/died were broilers - *you still have to immediately redirect 60 million eggs to the hatcheries to replace them.* That affects the prices of chickens and eggs.  60 million food chickens is equal to the American intake of 2 days worth.  That might not seem like much, but remove 2 days worth of oil from the market and see what that does to gas prices. 
3. The Time Magazine sources were *almost entirely from Farm Action and/or it's representatives, a biased anti-corporate action group who are making a claim based on their own analysis of one company's SEC filing.*   The only other sources in the article are the SEC filing itself, and one academic's quote that has nothing to do with the claim in the article. 
4. Farm Action's single argument seems to be that Cal Foods (and by extension the entire industry) was gouging because they earned too much money.
5. The question then becomes, how much is too much? Again this is basic math.  If an egg cost 5cents to make and ship, and I told it for 15cents, then I make ten cent profit.  If now my production cost is still 5 cents but the market is buying at 40 cents, I'm now making a 26 cents (or 500%) profit.  Is that too much?  Why would they be obligated to sell below market value?
6. It doesn't mean the entire industry made this level of profits, in fact they probably didn't.  Cal Foods wasn't affected by the flu, so the increase in the value of their product was a windfall. There were other companies that saw essentially their entire flock get culled and had to rebuild from zero. 
7. Honestly, Cub foods probably gouged more than they did, because Kwik Trip sold eggs for $3/doz while Cub sold for $5/doz.  I've always found Cub Foods to be the most predatory food retailer in the area.",2023-10-24 01:33:14,minnesota,Anger,0.9523329734802246

"Here’s the full post from the Raptor Center:

On April 12th and 13th, The Raptor Center responded to reports of three great horned owl nest mates in distress from a nest in Lake Nokomis Park in Minneapolis. On admission to our triage hospital building, all three were suffering from extreme neurological signs and one suddenly died. Due to a high level of suffering, the remaining two youngsters were humanely euthanized and all three tested for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). Today, not only did we receive notice that the young owl samples tested positive, but we also responded to calls about two deceased adult great horned owls in the same area, presumed to be the parents. We highly suspect that their samples will be positive too. 

We are heartbroken at The Raptor Center to see the presumed loss of an entire great horned owl family due to HPAI and unfortunately this is not the first one we have responded to during this outbreak. Nearly every day we are admitting patients that come in suffering from the severe symptoms of HPAI.

Minnesota is experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of HPAI in wild bird populations and unfortunately 90-100% of raptors who are infected will die from the disease. The Raptor Center is doing everything possible to continue to safely receive, triage, and treat birds in need during this difficult time and our team deeply appreciates all the help and the support from the community while we do so. 

If you find a raptor in need please call us at 612-624-4745 or visit our website at raptor.umn.edu

The Raptor Center's blurb on it

&gt;The United States is unfortunately experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in our wild birds. It is important to remember that all bird species are susceptible to HPAI- but how they show or do not show signs of illness and the role they play in carrying and spreading the disease will vary. This virus is shed in the feces and respiratory secretions of infected birds and is very hardy, with virus particles able to survive for weeks in cool, damp environments. In wildlife, we know the most about how this virus works and presents in waterfowl, shorebirds, seabirds- as these are the groups of birds who are most likely to carry and shed the virus without showing signs of illness. We know some about how this virus impacts groups of birds like raptors, as these birds often get severely sick and rapidly die from the virus. Unfortunately, we have a lot of gaps in knowledge about the role of songbirds in HPAI outbreaks. We have some data from previous outbreaks around the world, but this outbreak is very different. The 2022 outbreak is unique because of the very high levels of transmission of the currently circulating H5N1 virus strain in wildlife. With minimal viral surveillance being done with songbirds, it is hard to measure the risk of transmission from songbirds to other birds. Every day at The Raptor Center, we are seeing the impact of HPAI- as we triage and test birds like bald eagles and great horned owls that are intensely suffering from fatal neurological illness due to HPAI. With these infected birds, humane euthanasia is the only tool we have left to help them. We also know that this strain and outbreak is causing severe illness in other species  like geese, ducks, blue jays, and crows.

"I don't see how my comment lacked nuance, but let me try again...

The real problem is that COVID is not a *major* virus, but it's also not a *minor* virus. A *major* viral pandemic would be something like H5N1 (the one most of us in the research community have been worried about for the last decade-and-a-half). The case fatality rate of H5N1 is close to 60%...so we wouldn't be talking about millions of dead, but more like *billions* of dead.

At the same time, COVID's case fatality rate is still greater than *literally any other currently circulating disease*. It's greater than HIV (with modern treatments). Without vaccination it's greater than malaria. Even *with* vaccination it's in the same ballpark as malaria, and malaria has a much more limited range. 2 years into the pandemic, and the statistics just recently released show that for those age 45-54, COVID was the leading cause of death in the US...more than cancer, more than heart disease, more than car accidents.

So, calling COVID ""minor"" depends heavily on how you define that term. If I asked you if a 1% case fatality rate was ""minor"", maybe you'd say yes. In that case, COVID, at a case fatality rate of somewhere between 0.1% and 0.05% would qualify as ""minor"".

But would you call the communicable disease with the highest case fatality rate of any disease currently circulating in the human population ""minor""?

Even when ""bird flu"" gets into a human, it doesn't spread easily from human to human.  And it has made the jump to humans directly from chickens many times.  Very deadly, but doesn't spread easily from human to human.

"Frankly, I don't understand how we haven't had runaway inflation for the past few decades with deficit spending, balance of trade, and all the Wall Street wizardry.  I really hope this isn't the time when we end up reaping the economic disaster we've sown for decades. 

However, there are a lot of recent problems that make it worse.   

Right winger or left winger, there have been a lot of big economic costs from COVID.  I think a lot of these costs are finally showing up in our pocketbooks. 

There have been around 1 million ""excess"" deaths in the USA, many of them involving long, expensive hospital stays.  Plus a large amount of medical expenses for those who didn't die.  Even without the effect of any mandated shutdowns.  That's a lot of economic damage to the economy that does trickle down/sideways to affect all of us.   

Businesses are finding staffing much harder, absenteeism, supply chain issues, quiet quitting, etc.   

The drought/heat wave has certainly been a big hit to food production.  

Lots of chickens were slaughtered during the bird flu outbreak.  

Runaway housing and real estate prices sound good to some people, but eventually the pyramid scheme runs out of new suckers, the music stops, the illusion vanishes, and most of us are left holding the bag. 

At the same time rent increases suck a lot of money out of the disposable income that powers a lot of the economy. Also the cash flow that business tenants need to hire people.  Then they pass that cost on to their customers.  

Then the government screws you double with the property tax increases. 

The Ukraine war hits a lot of things.  Wheat.  Fuel supplies.  War is expensive, taking a lot of resources out of productive use. 

Climate change is starting to have more and more impact on the economy.  Energy costs during the heat wave.  Impacts to food production from drought and heat. Storm damage and flooding.  Icepocalypse 21. Even when we DO do the right thing and take measures to mitigate CO2 production, that costs money and resources, too, especially short term. Corn ethanol production pulls a lot of food out of the food chain, increasing prices. 

I think there's a lot of economic pain backed up behind the dam and it's got to come out sometime.  I just hope we can trickle it out slowly rather than in a disastrous economic collapse.

"Hi, I too am still obsessed about the wastewater. You might find an article from the end of the year discussing how Austin Public Health was switching from Biobot to another lab to do the testing, the other lab presumably being Verily. However, no Travis Co info has ever appeared on Verily. There was another interview with a health official saying that the results they were getting from the other lab were wack, and that they wouldn't publish them until they had a longer line of data. My personal theory is that the results were just really high, as there seemed to be a ""second winter surge"" in January. Anyway, I watch Verily every day to see if Austin ever shows up, but all I see is fewer and fewer Texas sites being reported. I watch Dallas sites just to see how they're trending.

And so, I had given up entirely on Austin wastewater testing, until I saw this report this week:

"There are two questions here.

1-What do you worry about?

2-What should you worry about?

&amp;#x200B;

The Austin specific natural disasters people worry about are probably about 1% of the risk of something killing you here in Austin.  

# Hurricanes -

They basically don't come here, although we do sometimes get flooding from them.  See comments on flood deaths.

[Hurricane tracks.](https://new.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1dw8yag/50_years_of_austin_hurricane_tracks/)  Note that the ones that did get close were tropical storm (40 MPH) or lower intensity.

Of course, the big one with our name on it may be waiting in the wings.  Especially with global warming.   

# Tornadoes -

People have a lot of fear about tornadoes.  In the Jarrell outbreak in 1997, 27 people died in Williamson County,  and 1 in Travis county.   Between 1998 and 2022, one person died in either Travis or Williamson County.

[Tornado Tracks 1950-2022](https://mrcc.purdue.edu/gismaps/cntytorn#)

Salads kill more people than tornadoes.

# Floods -

Kills more than tornadoes.  I don't have statistics handy, but it's not really that many per year in an an area with 2 million people.   If you pay a little attention when choosing where to live, you won't get flooded.  Austin has low spots and high spots.  Check the flood plane maps.

Most of the flood deaths are people who tried to drive through water running over the road, or went into the flooded area on foot.

&amp;#x200B;

# Heat -

Heat probably kills more than any other natural ""disaster,"" but it's only occasionally in big groups that make the news.   It's usually one person at a time.   And then, construction workers and poor people, which doesn't make the news.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fire -

Some risk of California-style megafires.   Probably worse out in the rich neighborhoods out west, but not impossible in the flatland neighborhoods.   Stay out of the obvious fire death zones with hills and lots of trees.  Be sure you're in an area with exit roads in all directions so you can escape.  Some of the rich neighborhoods out west are disasters waiting to happen.

You can do some things like keep trees away from the house to reduce your risk.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the other big risks are not Austin specific.

Man made risks like car accidents and getting stabbed by a street zombie are probably your biggest risks.  And don't forget the salads.

One of the biggest natural disasters is disease.   COVID probably killed 100x more people in the past 4 years than hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and heat put together.   Flu probably kills 10x as much as those things most years.  If bird flu learns to spread like normal flu, it's going to make COVID look like the sniffles.",2024-07-09 11:53:09,austin,Fear,0.963800609111786

"Surely you find a difference between killing animals for food and killing animals for superstition? Additionally, while far from perfect, society as a whole has decided that even livestock animals have certain rights and protections. Sure, those protections are not respected more often than not, but the fucking compass is pointed SOMEWHERE, which is the avoidance of unduly pain whenever possible. Which is why chickens are electrocuted before slaughter, and cows stunted, and pigs killed with as much precision as possible. And sometimes when abuses do make it to the public, people go to jail and factories are fined. An amateur decapitating a dove they likely purchased from some crowded, unregulated backyard facility doesn’t take any of this considerations, they goal is indeed to cause the animal pain. Also noteworthy, birds are notorious for carrying viruses that easily make the animal-human jump, so regulated animal facilities go to great pains to monitor flock health, and medicate as needed or cull the entire flock in the presence of avian flu or other threats to human health.

"A big reason for the price increase is because they had to  kill over 100 million hens to stop the spread of avian flu.

https://www.kktv.com/2023/01/05/whats-causing-dramatic-increase-egg-prices/


Another  reason for the price increase - and not the only reason - is consumer demand for better treatment of egg laying hens.

 As of 2010, 97% of eggs are produced by chickens raised in battery cages. That means hens packed into cages so tight they can't even lift their wings or lay down, each bird allotted a space smaller than an 8 1/2"" by 11"" sheet of paper. Consumer demand forced a big change in the industry, now about 60% are produced this way and estimates are that by 2025 it'll be 30%.

 https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2022-02-10/cage-free-chicken-campaign-scores-surprising-success

That meant the industry had to spend the money to improve facilities for the hundreds of millions of egg laying hens.

Cage-free is a little better - instead of being crammed into cages they're crammed into barns with an average space for chicken of about three sheets of paper.  But they're still in unsanitary conditions, and develop new health problems. In addition, workers in these barns are experiencing respiratory issues from all the dust and chicken waste and also physical injuries from the ergonomic demands of having to gather eggs in a setting that's less of a factory than with caged eggs.

https://nyti.ms/29Y58As

Free range doesn't mean what most people think it does - it just means they have to have access to the outside. But that access can be a small door that the chickens don't even know is there.

https://www.eater.com/2019/7/17/20696498/whats-the-difference-cage-free-free-range-pasture-raised-eggs

Even in the best circumstances chickens are used up and discarded. A chicken in the wild lays about 20 eggs a year.  The commercial chickens are bred and fed a particular diet which forces them to lay as many as 250 eggs a year.

As you may have guessed, I don't eat eggs.

* Cheaper eggs more likely come from factory farms which are the perfect environment for disease to spread

"Sure! So, the “flu” refers to a group of viruses that are genetically related, but are not all identical. In fact, there are hundreds of different viruses that can cause the flu! There are a few hundred different breeds of dogs, so you can think of it like that - a dog is a dog, but there are hundreds of different kinds with distinct features, and there are also tons of possibilities of genetic mashups to make mutts. We can group dogs into categories; for example, large, medium, and small, or we could group them by function like tracking or hunting or novelty or whatever. You get the idea. We do the same with flu viruses; categorize them into functional groups. That’s why you might hear things like Flu A versus Flu B, or you might hear someone mention the H5N1 group versus H1N1, for example. 

Now, every year a group of smart, appropriately-educated and experienced folks use sophisticated computer algorithms to predict which of the hundreds of different strains of flu are likely to be the most prevalent in the upcoming season. Any given vaccine can only contain antigens from maybe four different strains of the flu (“antigen” is what we call an identifier that your immune system can use to recognize the virus; think of it like being given a photo of a chihuahua so you could later recognize that breed of dog if you saw one at the park). So each year the experts say, what are the four strains of flu that we are most worried about? Which are the top viruses that could make the most people sick this year, or that could cause the most harm in infected individuals? Once those have been identified, they are packaged up into a vaccine. 

The vaccine is very effective at preventing illness from those four top flu viruses. But, again, there are hundreds of flu viruses! Just like dogs though, some breeds are very similar to each other, so the flu vaccine can also be protective for many other strains that happen to be similar to the four included in the shot. And there are even more strains that are not similar enough for the vaccine to prevent disease; however, they are juuust similar enough for your body to go, “hmm, this seems familiar, I think I know what to do here!” and the illness is relatively mild or short. 

Plus, if you get a flu shot every year, then every year your body is learning about new variations of the flu. Even if the flu shot “wears off” after a while, your body at least has that experience under its belt, and in the future if you’re exposed to a variation of the virus that you were vaccinated for several years ago, you might get sick, but it may still be more mild than it would have been if you weren’t getting vaccinated. 

However, here’s the thing. There are still hundreds of these little suckers and every now and then, you’re going to encounter one that is totally new to your body, or is just some kind of mutt of a virus that your immune system doesn’t quickly recognize. If you don’t get vaccinated regularly, this is more likely to occur, but it can happen to anyone. When it happens, you get sick with the flu. Sometimes really sick. And it doesn’t matter whether or not you got your flu shot that particular year, because this virus is not one of the ones in the vaccine. It’s a random troll you picked up somewhere, and it’s going to take your body a while to mount a specified immune response and figure out the best way to get rid of it. And that is how, even after receiving the flu shot, you can still get the worst flu of your life. But it’s also the reason why you *should* get the flu shot every single year, to lessen the chances you will encounter a strain totally foreign to your immune system.",2023-08-03 01:36:09,austin,Fear,0.7095990777015686

"Cal-Maine Foods

FTA:

“The largest egg producer in the United States said Tuesday that it temporarily ceased operations at one of its Texas facilities after detecting bird flu in chickens — the latest in a steady uptick of cases among U.S. farm animals in recent weeks.

Cal-Maine Foods said it culled about 1.6 million hens and 337,000 pullets (young hens) after some of its chickens at a Parmer County, Texas, facility tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild and domestic birds.

A dairy worker in Texas was being treated for the virus that causes avian influenza, becoming only the second known human case in the United States, state and federal officials said Monday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the person tested positive for H5N1 bird flu.

The culled chickens at Cal-Maine Foods represent 3.6 percent of its flock as of March 2, it said. The company said “no farm is immune from HPAI” but added that it “remains dedicated to robust biosecurity programs across its locations.”

Minnesota officials reported the first infection of bird flu among livestock in the United States last month, when a juvenile goat living on a farm with infected chickens tested positive.

Last month, bird flu was also detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas. Later that week, U.S. officials said that cows in Michigan had tested positive and that there were presumptive positive tests among cows in Idaho and New Mexico, suggesting that the virus may be spreading among cattle.

On Tuesday, Michigan’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced that bird flu was detected at a commercial poultry plant in Ionia County, “the fourth detection of HPAI in a commercial facility” since the virus was first spotted in the state in 2022.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture also said Tuesday that cases were detected in a dairy cow herd in Idaho.

Officials have said the risk to human health remains low. But the CDC has warned that people with unprotected exposure to infected birds or other animals, including livestock, are at greater risk of infection.

People should also avoid uncooked or undercooked food, unpasteurized milk and raw cheese, according to the CDC. Cooking eggs or poultry to an internal temperature of about 165 degrees Fahrenheit generally “kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses,” it says. Backyard chickens or pet chickens are at risk if they come in contact with wild birds carrying the virus.

Human symptoms of bird flu include eye redness, fever, coughing, sore throat, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or seizures are less common, the CDC said.”",2024-04-04 01:29:20,texas,Fear,0.9920628666877748

"In early February, dairy farmers in the Texas Panhandle began to notice sick cattle. Nearly 60 days passed before veterinarians identified the culprit: a highly pathogenic strain of the bird flu virus, H5N1. Had it been detected sooner, the outbreak might have been swiftly contained. Now it has spread to at least eight other states, and it will be hard to eliminate. 

Why did it take so long to recognize the virus on high-tech farms in the world’s richest country? Because even though H5N1 has circulated for nearly three decades, its arrival in dairy cattle was most unexpected. Tests for contagious diseases known to whip through herds came up negative. Some farmers wondered if the illness was related to ash from wildfires devastating land to the east.

An early indication that something had gone awry on farms in northwestern Texas came from devices hitched to collars on dairy cows. Darren Turley, executive director of the Texas Association of Dairymen, describes them as “an advanced fitness tracker.” They collect a stream of data, such as a cow’s temperature, its milk quality, and the progress of its digestion — or, rather, rumination — within its four-chambered stomach. What farmers saw when they downloaded the data in February stopped them in their tracks. One moment a cow seemed perfectly fine, and then four hours later, rumination had halted. “Shortly after the stomach stops, you’d see a huge falloff in milk,” Turley said. “That is not normal.”

In hindsight, Turley wished he had made more of the migrating geese that congregate in the panhandle each winter and spring. Geese and other waterfowl have carried H5N1 around the globe. They withstand enormous loads of the virus without getting sick, passing it on to local species, like blackbirds, cowbirds, and grackles, that mix with migrating flocks. But with so many other issues facing dairy farmers, geese didn’t register. 

Sometime in March, viruses appear to have hitched a ride to other states as cows were moved between farms. The limited genomic data available links the outbreak in Texas directly to others in New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota. However, the routes are imprecise because the USDA hasn’t attached dates and locations to data it releases.

Researchers don’t want to be caught off guard again by the shape-shifting H5N1 virus, and that will require keeping tabs on humans. Most, if not all, of about 900 people diagnosed with H5N1 infections worldwide since 2003 acquired it from animals, rather than from humans, Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at the World Health Organization said. About half of those people died.

Occasional tests of sick farmworkers aren’t sufficient, he said. Ideally, a system is set up to encourage farmworkers, their communities, and health care workers to be tested whenever the virus hits farms nearby.",2024-05-24 05:20:29,texas,Sadness,0.9730473160743712

"There absolutely is a chance they can get avian influenza from wild birds that may be infected.

That's not to say it's guaranteed or a very high risk, but having awareness and being prepared/taking precautions is good.

H5N1 is just a highly transmissible type of avian influenza, unfortunately (there are low transmissible and high transmissible types of avian flu), so the risk/chance is greater.

[This PDF from the USDA may be helpful!](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/bro-protect-poultry-from-ai.pdf)",2024-05-13 12:36:03,texas,Fear,0.5090633034706116
"Because of the near 100 % mortality in wild birds (largely passerines)  and commercial chicken and turkey flocks ,and potential virulency when it jumps to humans (aout 50% mortality) global monitoring of of H5N1  and its ""cousins"" has been a top priority since the late nineties.  H5N1 highly pathogenic avian flu is highly mutable and often described as ""the big one"" by virologists and epidemiologists. Covid is referred to as ""preparedness practice"" for a H5N1 human pandemic.  I feel relieved that many countries are alert, have been historically prepared or beginning to prepare. Many have stockpiled somewhat effective antivirals and prototype vaccines. The vaccine use ""old technology' and would require many months to ramp up production...that is a worry.  I hope we are working on new fast technology vaccines.  

  
What can we do? 

1.Pressure the FDA and related federal agencies  to ramp up monitoring and reporting of H5N1 in wild mammals (48 species to date have been affected), in commercial animal stock including dairy and beef cattle, and pigs and goats. Infections in pigs are especially concerning as we share similar genetic vulnerabilities"" to many pathogens.

3. Begin informing and educating the public, and listening to farmers. I have been impressed with local responses in the chicken and dairy industry. Farmers are very worried . They need the latest information as it emerges. But I worry that politics and money will carry more weight than public health. the FDA and associated federal agencies have their heads in the sand about this.  The public needs to be better informed and risks. 

4. Always be personally prepared for epidemics and pandemics. 

  
Where to go for information?  

1. I go to PubMed , where you can find all scientific papers and government documents from every country. But the papers are difficult going. Still if you want to try - do a search on avian flu in humans and limit it to the year 2023- 2024. I also go to the virology chat rooms. The science is pretty heavy but you can see the science reported without fear of government repercussions .. remember what happened to the chinese scientists and doctors who tried to warn about Covid in late 2019?

2. The WHO is more informative than the CDC.  

3. Media? Its tough to separate the fact from the fake.  As a biologist who teaches students to separate science fact from fake science the media source that is most scientifically/medically correct is the New York Times science section. ..not the editorials.  Many of the other media sources are loaded with disinformation.

4. Science News is an on line journal that takes the latest science and reviews it for the public. Its excellent.

5. I find it most useful to do a google search on : Avian Flu and set the date screen to most recent. Glance through the headings from scientific, academic and health sites to get a feel about the global and local impacts. Do look at new reports from our agricultural belts. See what our farmers and ranchers  are experiencing .

6. Avoid social media and conspiracy websites .. you want the cleanest, least politicized science and medicine  so you can make the most informed decision.

There have been several infected humans at this point, all from contact with infected cows and their bodily fluids, etc.

As of this moment, there is no recorded human to human transmission, and the virus would need to undergo the right mutations for that to happen.
But people can get sick from ingesting or improperly handling infected raw milk, raw cheese, or raw beef.

For what it's worth, the H5N1 virus is confirmed in a fairly large number of US dairy farms, not just in Texas.

"You can check out the r/H5N1_AvianFlu subreddit which gets a lot of updates shared.

Some commenters are very level headed, some are bordering on prepping for a big outbreak, some are convinced the world will end and everyone will die.

As of right now, I don't think there's any significant risk of infection UNLESS you actively work in a dairy/cow farm, chicken/poultry farm, or interact regularly with animals that have been confirmed to be infected with the virus. Also, if you are actively avoiding handling and consuming raw OR undercooked beef, eggs, chicken, milk, cheese, etc, your risk is extremely low.

From my understanding, the virus has not reached human to human transmission. All confirmed human infections are from people who interacted with sick/infected animals/spaces.

The virus does need to go through certain mutations to be able to become human to human transmissible.

ONE of these mutations has been confirmed, but it needs to go through multiple mutations.

IF the virus is detected in pigs, these mutations become more likely and the risk becomes greater.

Other animals interacting with infected farm animals have fallen ill with quite severe symptoms and have died, including farm cats as well as a domestic NON farm cat, so the virus may be spreading to other cats outside of these farms.

Owners should keep their cats indoors, and also make sure their dogs don't try to lick/eat bird poop or raw/undercooked beef/eggs/dairy(if you feed your pet a raw/freeze dried diet, this is a legitimate concern).

The CDC has highly recommended farm workers wear appropriate PPE, but they essentially said the CDC can f•ck off and that they won't take extra necessary precautions.

But, as of right now, in this moment and stage of the virus, I wouldn't be too concerned if you're being careful about what you and your pets consume. Maybe also avoid spending time with any friends or family that actively work on at risk farms if you want to be extra extra extra cautious. This would be moreso due to if they have virus particles on their person from farm animal feces/fluids that you could pick up, not so much about any human to human transmission risk.

Additionally, the appropriate entities have stated that an adequate vaccine specifically for H5N1 could be created in a matter of weeks with an expedited rollout in the event that it does become human to human.

The greatest risk is in those early weeks/months before people can get vaccinated, so at the earliest confirmation of any human to human spread, just make some life changes and be extra careful(we all know how different people will handle this stage based on the Covid pandemic).",2024-05-13 04:13:32,texas,Neutral,0.4581758975982666

Other outbreaks have occurred where the infectivity rate is low and you can only transmit when symptoms are showing. The diseases are still difficult to contain, but we do a much better job. Swine Flu raged a couple years ago.. it was bad, but nowhere near as bad as COVID.

With H5N1, we have some vaccines, therapeutics and tests. As I understand it, the Flu A tests works on H5N1. I am not saying that scientists have a handle on it, but they know a lot about this flu already. As I understand it, there are very few human cases.

It could take days or years for it to transfer to humans in a form that is more transmissible. No one knows.

"I would probably be slightly concerned about feeding raw poultry or beef based foods to my pets since cats are confirmed to be vulnerable to the virus.

Commercial companies should be doing their own testing and due diligence to guarantee a safe and healthy product, but there definitely can be instances where something is missed or not properly cleared.

For instance, the local farm I buy my dairy from had an issue just recently when pasteurizing their chocolate milk and extended a recall and urged anyone who purchased the milk to return it for a full refund. Pasteurization neutralizes the virus.

It is a risk that the turkey in your pets food may be sourced from a farm that failed to properly cull/clear the virus from their flock before sending out bad meat and the pet food company may do their own testing but some bad batches may get out and be fed to pets before they catch it and issue a recall.

It's essentially a risk you have to decide if you want to take.

There are pet recalls on kibble based foods and canned foods. Sometimes, things just get through their protocols. I would personally consider raw pet foods to be a higher risk for now, though, just because of how widespread H5N1 seems to be across various farms and testing can't seem to keep up.",2024-05-13 11:40:29,texas,Anger,0.9277553558349608

Summary: Transmission of the current strain in cows is strange. It is not resperatory but seems to be passed from cow udder to udder in the milking area.  The strain does not have receptor binding domains for human or cow resperatory cells. The only documented cow to human case was conjunctividas because the human eye does have receptors for the strain. Cases in humans and other mammals are most likely under-tested and undercounted.

"I'm going to sound like an HEB shill, but two of the big things I love about them are that it's a company where it's still possible to [work your way up](https://careers.heb.com/from-checkout-to-corporate/) and how carefully they've worked to stay ahead of potential problems. 

I know other people have mentioned their disaster preparedness, but the way they handled the supply chain issues during the beginning of the covid shutdowns and the way that they handled that situation in store are part of what I love about them. There's a couple different [articles](https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/heb-prepared-coronavirus-pandemic/) from [Texas Monthly ](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/how-heb-became-emergency-preparedness-model/)that highlight some of the ways that they were more prepared to deal with an infectious disease pandemic than other stores (or the federal or state government). 

Some of the quotes from the March 2020 article looking at why they were better prepared and how they responded:

**""Justen Noakes, director of emergency preparedness, H-E-B:** Just a little bit of history: we have been working on our pandemic and influenza plan for quite a while now, since 2005, when we had the threat of H5N1 overseas in China. That’s when we first developed what our plan looked like, \[as well as\] some of our requirements and business implications. In 2009, we actually used that plan in response to H1N1, when [**the swine flu came to fruition in Cibolo**](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103744903), and refined it, made it more of an influenza plan. We’ve continued to revise it, and it’s been a part of our preparedness plan at H-E-B ever since.  

**Craig Boyan, president, H-E-B:** Justen leads our emergency preparedness with a group of folks, and that is a full-time, year-round position. We are constantly in a year-round state of preparedness for different emergencies. We keep emergency supplies at almost every warehouse and have water and other supplies staged and ready to go and kept in storage to make sure that we are ready to \[react quickly\] when a crisis emerges, whether it be a hurricane or a pandemic. We take being a strong emergency responder in Texas, to take care of Texas communities, very seriously.  

**Tina James,** **chief people officer, H-E-B:** For example, when we saw what was happening with the volume, we asked at corporate if people wanted to volunteer to take shifts in the stores and at the warehouses. We immediately had hundreds—800 corporate folks volunteered for 350, 400 shifts in our stores and warehouses, to be able to help out and give some relief to our stores. 

**Stephanie Lowe, customer**: I met Alma, who has been with H-E-B for 21 years, if I recall, and works in the store’s bookkeeping department. She had answered the “all hands on deck” call and was working checkout for the first time in years and she was so excited. She kept saying how much fun she was having being back at checkout and took great delight in looking up the codes to ring up produce. It was such a positive interaction in the midst of organized chaos, and I have thought about it throughout the week at work when things have been stressful.""

"This is something that I've been keeping close tabs on because we raise our own ducks and geese.

This particular strain has been going through bird flocks from Asia to Europe and now to the US and North America like wildfire. Waterfowl apparently don't show any symptoms, just mysteriously die. Dryland birds like chickens and turkeys show symptoms but die quickly, and the entire flock gets very sick very fast and often dies off within days. It is only jumped to a couple of people, and they were ones who worked closely with sick animals in not so clean conditions. The odds of this bird flu jumping to humans at this point, I think, is pretty low given that it has been spreading around the world with migrating birds and affected many small flocks and commercial flocks as well. A whole lot of humans have been exposed with no sickness. It also does not seem to be jumping to other mammals.

The infected flock in Michigan is a homestead flock not far from me, and there are a lot of us in Southwest Michigan who have small flocks. We are keeping our birds inside their duck yard when we have been allowing them to free-range. They are recommending that people keep their birds either inside a coop that cannot be infiltrated by wild birds or do what they can to keep food and water away from wild birds and follow serious biohazard protocols. Gloves only for the barn, boots only used in the barn, stuff like that.

"Industry concentration can certainly be a factor, but are you contending that the concentration of power you cite as the cause of higher egg prices only came into being during the pandemic, and wasn't present before? 

Because eggs at Aldi were like $0.88/dozen pre-pandemic and its associated stimulative economic measures. In fact, at one point in 20198 or 2019 they were under $0.50/dozen at Aldi and I joked that the birds might go on strike. Then they got up to the $4 - $5 range, and now are $2.xx. 

These prices don't seem to correlate well with the degree of concentration in the industry. Was concentration really low in 2019, really high in 2022 and now decreasing again in 2023?

Or is it more reasonable to look at market issues like avian flu, seasonal demand patterns, and feed and transportation costs?


&gt; **Why are egg prices so high?**

&gt;Since the start of 2022, highly pathogenic avian influenza has led to the deaths of about 58 million birds. It is the deadliest outbreak of all time and the worst one since 2015, when 50 million birds were culled, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data.

&gt;U.S. egg inventories were 29% lower in the final week of December 2022 than at the beginning of 2022, according to the USDA. More than 43 million egg-laying hens had died as a result of the malady by the end of December. 

&gt;“Lower-than-usual shell egg inventories near the end of the year, combined with increased demand stemming from the holiday baking season, resulted in several successive weeks of record-high egg prices,” USDA economists said in a January research note.

&gt;Egg prices have also increased as part of overall food inflation driven by rising costs of labor, ingredients and logistics. Higher feed and transportation costs for producers mean shoppers will continue to face elevated egg prices even when the bird flu’s effects diminish, said CoBank ‘s Mr. Earnest.

"Farmers get tax breaks and such, but the industry is setting farmers up for failure. I’ll provide a link to an article that highlights common struggles in dairy farming, but there are issues in other segments of farming as well. Plant based large-scale farmers are typically under contract to purchase specific seed, and the seed is usually modified so they aren’t able to save seed from harvest to replant, meaning they always have to buy seed; oftentimes crops are grown in soils that are exhausted due to industrial farming, so they also are forced to purchase fertilizer; with the changing weather patterns, after these expenses sometimes crops even fail and then they make no money. In a lot of situations, farmers get very little profit off of their goods, which puts them in a cycle of debt and poverty, like the article states about the family owing hundreds of thousands of dollars on used farm equipment. There are tons of facets. I mean, some farmers now have to kill their entire flocks of chickens because of avian flu, that’s a huge financial loss. In summary I think industrial farming just isn’t working for our changing climate and for our consumer system that’s screwing not only the farmer, but the land. Here’s the article, but feel free to google a bit more and find more info for non-dairy farmers - it’s rampant and has kept me away from my dream idea of owning a farm.

I know the bird flu has been a serious problem for them, though the couple times I went, the chicken was one of the only things that have stayed consistent in quality.

I don’t think they’re changing the tea as often or putting lids on the top of their canisters, one time my friend found a fruit fly in his tea. Overall it seems things have gotten more lax there.

However, I will say that if Chipotle/other restaurants raise their prices to account for the higher chicken prices AND raises the price of their other protein options by the same amount as chicken; that is price gouging and using consumer psychology to maintain that beef/pork are luxury proteins and chicken isn't.

"&gt;Eggs? One of the food items that have increased in price the most in the past year?

ok, ok.  so i just smoked a bowl which tends to increase my tolerance for all kinds of pain, including the psychic pain incurred by reading this and the sadness i feel for you to believe all that makes sense.

eggs went up because of shortages due to bird flu, not demand due to poor people getting snap benefits. they're still a great source of protein and dirt cheap compared to say steaks, so your point is meaningless and one i figured you'd latch on to because it's *so fucking simple* and requires no thought past surface ones.

aside from the capitals on 'whole foods' which i'll assume your phone did for you, you're fucking nuts!  why do you think corn syrup is cheap again?  did it occur to you that the starting material must be even *cheaper*?  so much so you can process the shit out of it and still make money.

how about we just mill it into taco shells and give them away.  giving them away will cost more than the fucking taco shells.  labor is much more of a cost in any foodstuff than the actual food, that cost is included in your retail cost.

yes, *your* grasp of economics is certainly just a shade past econ 101, and it shows.

lets start with the bias you show when you categorize food assistance as ""free money"", shall we?  what IS free money to you?

does someone who inherited a house they never lifted a finger to earn receive 'free money'?  how about if they sell the house, buy bonds with that money and get interest every year without lifting another finger?  is THAT free money? 

or, even if they earned it working, and live off the interest, is that free money?

 how about banks that use your deposits to buy bonds and capture that interest?  that free money?  or if they lend against said bonds to capture MORE interest from someone buying a house?  they didn't create that money, or produce goods, not at all, nowhere along the chain, so, is that free money?

i think farmers are just fine with food subsidies, or they should be.  they're still getting paid no matter who consumes it and it benefits all of society when everyone is fed.

"Here's my thoughts to politely disagree with you and why

Put all the covid stuff aside for a minute - think for a moment about the very high chance we have of another pandemic with a completely different disease.  Right now bird flu has been infecting birds and mammals globally and spreading rapidly. very rarely it has infected humans and has not yet transferred human to human. But when it has infected humans, it's roughly a 50% survival rate. About half the people infected so far have died.  It is a matter of time before this virus mutates so that it can be transferred more easily to humans and between humans.  Seriously - this is not an if but when. 

And when that happens think about all the people who refused to wear masks in public during covid who got violent and acted out and thought covid was fake - now we have those same people who are going to hop on the conspiracy train again ever more than last time because there's ANOTHER pandemic.  Except now instead of a 1% death rate like with covid it's almost 50%.  

 There will still be people who have to go out in public to keep society running. Can you imagine if that was you, or someone you love knowing that if they got infected it would be a coin flip if you or they survived?  

I would want our government to use every tool we had to help protect everyone I cared about, so that the people who had no choice but to use public transport and public spaces would be a little more protected and maybe not have to get sick and suffer and die because some selfish assholes who were lucky enough to not get killed by the disease value their personal liberty so much they will kill half the other people they spread the disease to.  

I don't think we will have mask mandates again for covid. I think politicians talking about them now is because we have another variant and it becomes a talking point and a way to rally their base and garner support and make people mad about a problem that doesn't exist anymore. 

 But to make this impossible to do in the future when we could have a much more deadly disease where we want every tool available to curb the spread and keep our society and economy functioning is short sighted.",2023-09-07 03:22:46,Ohio,Sadness,0.7277144193649292

Still, OP is way off base thinking that small, local egg producers selling their eggs at a farmers’ market are going to be anywhere near as low as the prices of industrially produced eggs in a grocery store.

I don’t know about OP’s time, but my time is worth more than $10/hr.

"No offense to OP, but this post is a prime example of conspiracy thinking. I’m not calling you a conspiracy theorist, I don’t know you and I don’t know how serious you are about this idea. But I like breaking down this kind of thing…

“I found a dead bird in my yard. There are no apparent injuries, so the explanation isn’t obvious.”

There’s nothing wrong with this as an observation by itself, but the next step before adopting any explanation would be to come up with a testable hypothesis. “I don’t see another explanation” is not the same thing as “there is no other explanation.” It’s called an argument from ignorance fallacy: I don’t know any other explanation, so I’ve adopted this one. 

“There are harmful chemicals in the air due to the East Palestine incident. Last night it rained and now there’s a dead bird. Could it be related?”

Again, as a question, there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with asking this. But a suggested explanation shouldn’t be adopted without clear evidence. “It’s possible” is not the same thing as “it’s actual.” Plus, one would need to demonstrate that a specific explanation is even possible before offering it. Has it been demonstrated to be possible for chemicals to travel from East Palestine to Dayton through clouds and rain? If it’s not shown to be possible, it’s not a candidate explanation. 

And correlation is not causation. “My rooster crowed this morning and the sun came up. My rooster must have caused the sunrise!” Two things happening near each other doesn’t mean there’s a causal link. 

Further, we have a single dead bird being floated as a possible pattern. We haven’t established a pattern yet, but let’s say we did. Let’s say more dead birds are found… maybe 5, maybe 10, maybe 1000. Maybe every single bird in Ohio drops out of the sky and dies. We would still need evidence to demonstrate a link between the events in East Palestine and the death of the birds. Simply assuming or asserting a connection is not sufficient, it must be demonstrated. 

Maybe, as another commenter pointed out, it’s avian flu. Maybe there are toxic chemicals in the air from the train derailment AND there’s also something else killing birds. Both could be true. Conspiracy thinking tends to adopt a simple explanation quickly, without considering all options. (Simple meaning satisfying to the person; it doesn’t mean conspiracy theories can’t be complex or complicated. Look at the various features included in OP’s potential explanation)

Conspiracy thinkers also fixate on anomalies. They focus on specific details which stand out or don’t seem to fit, while sometimes ignoring or missing other data. There may be hundreds of living birds flying around OP’s house, but they’ve focused on the dead one. If this is done intentionally (pointing to specific examples that match the theory and ignoring examples that don’t), it’s called cherry-picking.",2023-02-16 01:16:10,Dayton,Sadness,0.6026977300643921

"Avian Flu is **extremely rare** to be detected in any sort of North American songbird/backyard bird. How rare? It has been observed twice. Ever.



* A single Cooper’s Hawk reported in Wisconsin. 


* A single Blue Jay in Nova Scotia tested positive.



* *Maybe* a crow to really stretch it. Not confirmed. 



The role of songbirds in avian flu is just a big scientific gap. No one really knows for *absolute certain*. Surveillance isn't huge, and that's because we know they aren't a major factor. Right now there is no evidence to suggest songbirds play any real role in the spread of avian flu.


As of this week there have been [5 detected cases of avian flu in Colorado.](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/avian-influenza-surveillance?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objectsOne) 1 backyard chicken flock, and 4 wild water fowl.

* Don't go messing around with dead birds. Especially waterfowl. 


* Got backyard chickens, turkey, geese, ducks, quail? Probably best not to put out a bird feeder. That seems very reasonable, just to be safe.


* Otherwise, it would be quite an *extreme* decision to avoid a bird feeder all together IMO. But you should clean them once a month any way (9 parts water to 1 part bleach). Even just to avoid mold and poop build up.

"https://raptor.umn.edu/about-us/our-research/HPAI

The Raptor Center has a good explanation on the unknowns related to avian flu and why you should take down bird feeders. 

""Every day at The Raptor Center, we are seeing the impact of HPAI- as we triage and test birds like bald eagles and great horned owls that are intensely suffering from fatal neurological illness due to HPAI. With these infected birds, humane euthanasia is the only tool we have left to help them. We also know that this strain and outbreak is causing severe illness in other species  like geese, ducks, blue jays, and crows.

During these unprecedented times, we recommend doing anything that we can to try and help our wild bird populations. Because the science is unclear on the role of songbirds in this current H5N1 outbreak, one consideration is to not encourage birds to gather together at places such as bird feeders or bird baths. These are places where things like viruses could easily be exchanged between individuals.

In areas with HPAI transmission in any avian species, consider pausing the use of bird feeders and baths for the next couple of months until the rate of virus transmission in wild birds dramatically decreases. Not only will this action help to protect those beautiful feathered creatures that visit your yard, but will also help all wild bird species that are already having it  hard this spring because of HPAI. We have it in our power to take a short term action so we are not accidentally assisting in the virus’ spread.  This outbreak won’t last forever and I, for one, am greatly looking forward to when I can safely hang my bird feeders back up!""",2022-04-17 04:12:47,Denver,Sadness,0.9898701310157776

"Avian Flu has been decimating laying operations

The answer is that supply is significantly reduced. I'm not sure I would go so far as to say there is a shortage per se, but the ""input"" side of the equation is impacted enough that a grocery store may be caught short if their buyer is not ahead of the game.

Maybe it's at the ""pre-shortage"" stage? If things continue as they are there will be chronic outages, though I don't think we've quite crossed that watershed YET we are headed that direction.

Edit: the immediate ""this week"" outage is probably a combination of things -- most notably, something like Thanksgiving converges pretty much ALL sales patterns into a single event, and it is to be expected that there would be a run on grocery stores 5-8 days later.

Most of the year you might go once a week, your neighbor every 5 days, a different neighbor twice a week, etc -- the buyer at the grocery store can more or less estimate that large-scale 'average' pattern. But a bottleneck event like Thanksgiving pinches everything into one event, which is known/obvious, but the followup is also important. People will ""run out"" at more or less the same time following the holiday and need to restock...everyone at once. If the buyer at the store did not plan for THAT convergence they could be caught flat in any case and add to that a reduction in production...and you have empty shelves.

As individual's buying patterns re-establish and spread out over the next week or two the store-level averaging patterns will re-establish themselves and you should see a return to normal.

That said, prices will continue to rise regardless until this round of the flu passes but at an industry level (not the farm level) I expect the normal sequence of hatch-raise-lay for hens will continue as they have been throughout the bird pandemic and supply should be maintained.

On a related note, the fact that sunflower prices are up (see: Ukraine/Russia, drought in the US, etc) means other oil-seeds will also rise, they tend to move as a set. Peanut, Safflower, Corn, Soy, Canola, etc. (these are all important cooking/human crops even if we don't account for animal feed). A reduced harvest of one oil-seed in a given year means consumption moves to another that, hopefully, had a better harvest in a given year. With corn and soy being common ingredients in animal feed, a small adjustment in costs would be expected even without avian flu and inflation making the rounds. (Fortunately, the cost of feed v. cost of eggs is a small impact for [reasons] but it is not zero).

Sunflower had a 15% jump wholesale in September/October after rising steadily the last year, and is expected to jump again sometime over the next year because European distributors are reportedly sitting on inventory due to the uncertainties related to the war in Ukraine. Many American harvests were impacted by drought this year, and now with the Mississippi being at record lows shipping from the Midwest -&gt; sea ports is nearly as hampered as the shipments in Ukraine, only difference is who is to blame. Domestic shipments can be done by rail of course, but price is still impacted dramatically.",2022-12-03 02:51:19,Denver,Sadness,0.9992958307266236

"You're forgetting the other half of the equation.  Namely supply.  If supply goes does (like recently with avian flu) and demand remains constant prices also go up. The idea behind the title, is that if you have to give chickens more space, given the same amount of land, you'll have less chickens and therefore less eggs, thus limiting supply.  Now I'm sure it's more complicated than that. For example, do chickens that have more space lay more eggs? Does regulation that draws attention to the source of eggs make people reconsider their choices to eat eggs in the first place?  Economics is more art than science so anyone who tells you definitely how things are going to go is selling something, I'm not trying to do that.  I'm just trying to clarify that there are more factors than just demand.",2022-12-13 01:25:29,Denver,Anger,0.5844460725784302

"With poultry, given the commonality of wild birds being primary vector for disease, the control of battery cage environment reduces spread of avian influenza. This is reflected in the academic literature. 

Of course there are mitigants in either environment, but perhaps counterintuitively, the proximity of mass-produced birds / eggs does not make the spread of avian flu more likely than if the birds are cage free and exposed to more environmental factors. 

In a sentence: the risk associated with close proximity in an industrial setting is outweighed by the inefficiency of biosecurity in a less controlled, or cage-free, etc. setting.

"From Wild Birds Unlimited's site, as linked, for the lazy:

&gt;Avian Flu has been found in a few limited cases in Corvids (Blue Jays, Magpies, Crows, and Ravens) the Corvids who have contracted Avian Flu all appear to have contracted the flu from eating other sick birds, there is no indication that those Corvids contracted it at feeders. In addition, the USDA has reported a total of 4 confirmed cases of Avian Flu in non-Corvid songbirds across the US in all of 2022, this too indicates that songbirds are not susceptible to Avian Flu and the disease is not at risk of being spread at birdfeeders.

 &gt;There is no need to stop watching, feeding, or attracting feeder birds to your yard because of avian flu. We do not recommend feeding or attracting waterfowl.

&gt;There is no evidence humans are at risk of contracting avian flu from backyard birds or bird feeding.

&gt;The backyard birds that visit our feeders appear to be significantly less susceptible and much less likely to become a source for the virus.

&gt;As with any bird or animal, wild or domestic, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions after direct or indirect contact. Be careful around animal droppings or water used by birds and animals; wash your hands after contact with soap and water.

&gt;It’s always a good idea to practice responsible bird feeding on a regular basis. Clean and sanitize all bird feeders, bird baths, and hardware. If you see or suspect a sick bird we recommend a 10% bleach solution (one-part bleach to nine parts water). For normal cleaning, a solution of half white vinegar and half water is a great natural option.

"&gt;Woodpeckers, flickers, and nuthatches are all groups notably present in avian flu death counts. 

Are you sure that nuthatches are being killed in large numbers by avian flu? That surprises me a little because nuthatches are classified as passerines or ""perching birds"", and the sites I consider most trustworthy say that passerines have not been seriously affected by the flu. (Passerines are often called songbirds, but ""perching bird"" is the more accurate definition, denoting how their [toes are arranged to grip branches](https://etc.usf.edu/clipart/72600/72658/72658_birdfeet_lg.gif).)

Woodpeckers are not passerines. Most larger birds are not passerines, including ""poultry"" (chicken, turkey), waterfowl (ducks, goose, pelican), shorebirds (heron, killdeer), raptors (eagle, hawk, owl), and scavengers (buzzard, condor). Many types of non-passerine birds have suffered losses from the avian flu.

"Passerine susceptibility is noted in specific environments where interactions with highly susceptible species are entwined (buntings, thrushes in particular). PCR positive necropsy cases with healthy body mass in surveys do find representation from flickers and nuthatches. But more concerning is the degradation of the environment, and nuthatches are susceptible and an indicator. Species and numbers for song and other birds are down by 30% over the past 50 years. Other species displaced from other areas are moving in to displace local species and the trend will continue as greater political pressure by people for higher density (ironically because they believe it is more environmentally friendly)  to raise local pollution levels and land uses that devastate insect populations (down a measured 60% or more in the past nearly 40 years in Colorado).

Eventually, you'll be able to drive for an hour without so much as a bug on the windshield, and as a result, the area will be devoid of most birds.

"Raw beef meat is certainly in the running as a potential zoonotic vector for H5N1 infection as well. 

I purchased these in late February (two boxes of 40 tests): 
https://www.vetassay-elab.com/p-avian_influenza_virus_h7_antigen_lateral_flow_assay_kit-178.html

I used them outside of the actual package directions, so it isn't a valid survey. I still think it is interesting. I swabbed raw meat samples from 7 stores in Boulder and Longmont, including two ethnic meat suppliers in Longmont. Selections from each store included vertebral cuts (T-bone, etc). The ""ethnic"" cuts additionally included lengua (tongue of course), and machitos (intestine). 

There were 17 samples in all. Control tests for each sample were done using swabs from regular Spam swabs(now is when you can laugh). 

Results:
Controls: zero positives.
samples: 3 positives for H5N1, 14 negatives
Zero inconclusive/failed tests.

The three positive samples were retained and re-tested, along with a random selection of three negative samples. All  three negative samples were negative again, and all three positive samples were positive again. 

The positive samples were each cooked in a pan at 460-485F on one side so than a thermometer read two different temperatures: For each of the two positive vertebral samples, placed adjacent to the bone to read to medium rare (130F-135F) and medium well (150F-155F), respectively, and for the machitos sample, at the center of a ball of the sample to read at 155F.  The samples were removed form the pan onto individual chilled glass Pyrex casseroles to rest for 5 minutes, and then swabs identical or comparable to tests numbers 1 &amp; 2 for each sample were taken, along with three Spam controls (at room temp) for each. The vertebral sample cooked to 152F tested positive. The other two tests were negative. The controls were all negative. 

No positive controls were available. No supplier would sell me H5N1 protein or RNA fragments to test with. And again, this test protocol was done outside of the printed label, and so the specificity and sensitivity is very much in question, or even the validity of the entire test. However, I am told that all samples were delicious after final preparation to a well done state (or broiled, in the case of the machitos). 

This proves nothing, of course. The tests, when used properly (which these were not), are very likely to react with and report on H5N1 specific antigens. It just suggests that beef should be investigated as an obvious potential vector for exposure to viable H5N1 virus. The FDA is doing exactly that as I write this now, and not because I've been asking just about every email address I can find in zoonotic virology research to consider the possibility after completing this test. It was an obvious direction for any researcher to go. 

https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/usda-beef-bird-flu/index.html

Ground beef (used in the government testing) generally contains a much higher level of nervous tissue that might be  associated with certain viral pathogens. I'm glad they are doing this for H5N1. It is unlikely they will report on any of the other viral antigen loads in the samples since RT-PCR is exceptionally target sensitive. 

As for H5N1 in milk, zero viral plaque forming units (PFU's) have, to date, been found from raw or pasteurized milk samples (in other words, the RNA was there but no detectable potentially viable viral particles). There are few cases where the association with raw milk consumption is strongly suspected in humans, but there are some. In previous studies, PCR fragments from a large variety of viruses has always been present, and are now joined by H5N1, again with zero PFU results in pasteurized samples, and very few in raw samples. 

It is still very easy to pasteurize milk if you are a small producer. It takes us about five minutes to get it going before starting dinner, five minutes to end in  a pail of water to chill after reaching 161F after getting ready to eat dinner, and almost nothing to clean up. That's enough for a few days to a week. 
Our milk is still warm from the udders before pasteurization in general, and it goes into the fridge immediately after processing. If equipment is spotlessly clean (and it should be), and animals are healthy, there is no way even for pathogenic bacteria to become a problem. But in the real world, things happen, and people get seriously sick occasionally and unnecessarily. It's not worth it in my opinion, given how easy pasteurization is.",2024-05-01 04:24:03,Boulder,Neutral,0.4546208381652832

"Appreciate the thoughtful response! I used deaths as a metric because I was comparing to deaths from lightning strikes, and I couldn't find stats for injuries.

The threat of pandemics does change the stakes, and as dairy can be a vector for H5N1, I think it would be prudent to stay away from raw milk until we have a better sense for the risks associated with that virus. As with most contagions, risk multiplies in factory farms (with tens of thousands of animals in close proximity, and weakened immune systems from poor living conditions). Small operations tend to be more resilient in those regards, but I would still want my milk tested on a regular basis.

Culture-wise, I see this more as an establishment vs. anti-establishment issue, but as Trump-era Republicans have begun to cast themselves as the anti-establishment party, it makes sense that they would fold this into their rhetoric.

"You may be drawing a conclusion that isn’t exactly there. I am not sure if you are insinuating that farm bird are dying from the bird flu in such numbers because they are weak farm birds. 

I mean healthy chickens give good eggs, and I’m all for that.

That said, the current bird flu appears to be moving through wild birds pretty quickly, which are pretty organic all things considered. 


Various state agencies are requiring mass slaughter of large amounts of chickens (millions) to try and slow or stop the outbreak from reaching wild birds so that it stops spreading. I mean it already has but that is a side point. 

Anyways “we” keep slaughtering millions of chickens that aren’t necessarily infected or otherwise affected. If testing shows an infection in a area generally all are killed quickly. “We” are slaughtering millions of chickens to attempt to stem the spread to wild birds and other industrial farming places. Often under orders by the state. 

Now you might make the argument that bird flu is more likely to start and gain significant foot hold due to factory farming. However it appears that once it gets out to wild birds, it’s still going to kill large amounts of them. So I’ll ask, which  robustness are you talking about?

"You seem to be putting words in my mouth. 

I have no problem with the industry not knowing about prions in advance. That's understandable: feeding cows mammalian proteins didn't have a harm that we knew of in advance, I had no objection to them doing that. Once it became clear though that mad cow was a possibility, the industry had a right to argue ""nah, lets ignore it, I'm sure its fine, cheaper hamburgers!"" but obviously the rest of society should have and did say ""absolutely not, you need to take steps to prevent mad cow tainting the food supply even if it costs more.""

Using bedding from chickens (I gather that's what's going on here) we evidently know to be a liability for spreading bird flu and it needs to stop. I don't blame the industry for using it initially if they didn't know it could cause human deaths to make slightly more profit, that's to be expected from any industry, but now we need to force them to stop doing it and we're fools if we don't pass laws stopping it.

I also have no complaint about inefficiencies leading to higher costs. I know I'm in the minority here but I do NOT think that it should be ""as cheap as possible"" if that ignores externalized costs like breaking antibiotics, spreading disease, and making the climate permanently unstable.

Saving five dollars off hamburgers at those ignored costs is not worth it to me. I'd much rather the meat industry do it safely (for the rest of the world) or not at all.

Again, that's on us, not the industry, to regulate it. We as a society are idiots if we don't pass laws banning antibiotics, the use of any and all technology to limit GHG (from livestock industries and all other industries) and implement a carbon tax as appropriate to be able to counter the effects of GHG externalized costs.

The meat and dairy industries won't do it on their own, except token gestures to get us to forget about it and think the problem is solved so they can keep maximizing profit.

"Fuck paywalls

&gt;Raccoon kills eaglet in Front Range bald eagle nest that’s livestreamed via webcam
Eaglet that perished at Xcel Fort St. Vrain nest was six weeks old. A sibling eaglet survived, as did the parents.

&gt;A six-week-old eaglet was attacked by a raccoon and killed at Xcel Energy’s Fort St. Vrain facility near Platteville on Monday, Colorado Parks and Wildlife has confirmed.
The bald eagle family has a large following because two “eagle cams” are focused on the nest around the clock. Many follow the eagles via the Fort St. Vrain Eagle Cam Facebook group.
A second eaglet survived the attack, as did the mother and father. CPW said wildlife officer Mike Grooms responded to investigate 90 minutes after the attack.
“The camera showed a raccoon scaling to the top of the nest tree and grabbing the older, larger of the two eaglets from the nest around 7 p.m.,” the CPW statement said. “Wildlife officer Grooms was able to collect what remained from the carcass and delivered it to CPW’s Wildlife Health Lab, where officials will submit it for testing of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.”
CPW noted that the nest dates back to 1993 and the camera went online in 2003.
“What followers saw on Monday was a natural event,” the statement said. “Predation of eaglets is not something you often hear about. Without a webcam, such events are hard to document. The vast majority of nest failures in Colorado are attributed to weather events (such as windstorms that damage or destroy nests or nest trees), new nests/inexperienced pairs, the loss of an adult during the nesting season and potentially human-related disturbance in the immediate area.
“The most likely mammalian predator of bald eagles in Colorado’s Front Range are raccoons, while avian predators include magpies, crows and ravens, hawks and owls.”

"The price of something is determined by supply vs demand. If there is a low supply and a high demand for a specific commodity (i.e. housing), the price will be high. In order to bring the price down, there either needs to be an increase in supply or a decrease in demand.

Building more houses increases the overall supply, thus lowering the price.

Another example is eggs. The price of eggs has increased dramatically recently because of an egg shortage due to a bird flu (avian influenza) outbreak that occurred over a year ago. The outbreak caused a drop in the number of chickens which then lead to a decrease in egg yield later on. The demand for eggs didn't change, but the supply went down. This caused the price of eggs to skyrocket. The only way to decrease the price of eggs (without government intervention) is to increase the supply of eggs. Until the supply of eggs increases enough to match the demand, expect high egg prices.

You can pick one, but not both.

As others have said, prices for ... well, everything have gone up in the last few years and chicken is one of those. Wings are no longer the leftover scraps that are sold for a fraction of what the other chicken parts are. I usually just bite the bullet and buy the [Kirkland Party Wings](https://sameday.costco.com/product/6603/kirkland-signature-%2522air-chilled%2522-chicken-party-wings) from Costco, but they're really not *that* much cheaper than boneless breasts and thighs (both $3.50/lb last I went) and season/sauce them myself since eating out has gotten really costly.

There was also a somewhat recent chicken shortage due to mass avian flu.

"Okay two thoughts. 

1) how can these apartments be luxury, but also faux luxury? Luxury is just a branding term. None of the ""luxury"" apartments are anything special. It's all just new housing that they want to pretend is flashy. 

2) that's exactly my point. We've chronically underbuilt housing, (and pretty reliably only allowed single family home) for at least since the financial crisis in 08 and probably before. We're so short on housing that vacancy rates are at an all time low, even at high prices! It seems obvious to me that replacing a few single family homes with 100 apartments is a clear win because we need the housing! Look at places that have wealthy residents and have fought up zoning effectively (aves, east bench, most of the suburbs). You got shitty 100 year old tiny houses selling for over a million because people want to live there! 

Remember when egg prices jacked up last year like crazy? It was because millions of chickens had to be killed because of an avian flu, restricting supply of eggs. Prices went up.

"Let me preface this by saying I don’t give a shit whether people wear them or not.

I’m with you man but calling mask wearing during a pandemic a dystopia really detracts from your original point and makes you look nutty. Especially saying that we weren’t wearing masks before for “thousands of years”. We also didn’t use soap, antibiotics, or GPS. GPS can track you. D Y S T O P I A. We also used masks during the Spanish flu outbreak. Asia used masks during the SARS and bird flu outbreaks. 

I agree that people are frustrated bc the state handled this all wrong from the jump. Government inefficiency is the real dystopia. And we can’t wear masks for ever, that shit is unrealistic. There is definitely a status quo made for wearing masks and I think in some cases there is over policing.

But using that word because it affects you way less as a healthy adult while others don’t want old and immunocompromised people to die is over the top. My friends and family have waited weeks and months for bodies that couldn’t be processed in a timely manner because of how many dead there were in the moratoriums and cemeteries. Shit was real. Not a dystopia. A reality.

That being said, it’s time. People have picked their side: vaxx’d or not. I think it’s fine to not require masks in places that aren’t medical centers or have concentrations of people with weakened immune systems. I think it’s fine to allow people to not wear them as long as they aren’t sick. Maybe the vax turns us all into 5G zombies, maybe the unvaccinated fuck around and find out. It is what it is now.

100% of the people I see calling this a dystopia literally just don’t want to wear a piece of cloth over their face rather than actually have substantive criticisms of the mandates and lockdowns. Not saying that this is or isnt the category you fall into but throwing around “dystopia” really sends that vibe.

Also saying you’ve been here for 20 years doesn’t mean anything.

&gt; After proliferating globally, a historic wave of avian flu has entered Southern California, where it is worrying farmers and bird lovers and could add to complications with supply chains and food prices.
Already, poultry operations have had to euthanize domestic flocks of chickens and turkeys, while thousands of wild birds have also died. Wildlife experts say they are seeing a wave of dying birds moving south — already as far as Irvine — as the fall migration sets in.

&gt; Authorities describe the surge as “unprecedented” in scope, breadth and lethality.

It CAN be transmitted to humans who handle infected birds, and it's very serious in people.

"It's because restaurant owners are worried that the market isn't ready for the actual cost of food. Years ago David Change wrote an article in GQ about how his $17 bowl of ramen really ought to cost $28, but the market wasn't willing to bear that price difference, and no one would come to eat it if he charged what he really needed to to keep that dish appropriately profitable. That was maybe 10 years ago, and the truth has remained the same. A workaround, which I also agree is disingenuous and a little shady, is to start adding these fees. 3% or 5% here and there isn't so bad. But it's quickly gotten out of control especially since COVID.  
  
COVID did a number on the restaurant industry as well. 4 years ago a case of eggs (180 ea), cost $40 a case. When the avian flu hit the egg producers 2 years ago, that price more than doubled. It was one of the major reasons The Nickel Diner couldn't remain open. Supply chains destroyed any predictability in getting proper goods. The EXTENSIVE limitations to styles of service and limited staff willing to work also destroyed many restaurants. All the smaller businesses lost out on the PPP loans to the larger more legally equipped counterparts.  
  
Yes, there are bigger investor-backed restaurants that can be greedy or whatever, but I guarantee you the people who love this business, like myself, are seeing fewer and fewer opportunities for growth and sustainability. I think we're going to see a reduction in style of service, like counter service style places instead of a server coming to the table, slimmer menus with fewer unique options, and a ""blanding"" effect of the entire industry.  
  
While I agree the fees are silly and are out of control, I'm also concerned guests will get some real sticker shock when a lot of restaurants, mine included, will have to increase their prices by a noticeable amount in July, which will lead to an extreme drop in business.

Also, Rancho San Miguel will often have their fuji apples on sale. Only 50 cents a pound right now, which is pretty spectacular! I've been getting my fuji's there for $0.99 per pound which is still really good, they just have an even better sale this week.

I got some Broccoli crowns at SaveMart on sale for $0.99 a pound the other day. (was a limited time sale)

Basically, what I'm saying is, if you only buy stuff as loss leaders, (digital coupons in the app), you'll beat these farmers markets 9 times out of 10.

"Industrially produced eggs are *very* dependent on energy, grain, and soy costs. Picture a long metal shed the size of a football field full of birds. Gotta vent out the shit fumes. You need artificial lighting that simulates daylight to keep production consistent through the winter. With the high density of most industrial operations you might even need actual HVAC in an area like Petaluma. 

You also need feed. A lot of it. That's grain and soy, but grain prices are high because of the invasion of Ukraine. Grain prices are also high because corn or wheat are nitrogen intensive crops; natural gas is the main feedstock for nitrogen fertilizer which is also an energy intensive process to create. Then it all needs shipping.


$7/doz is probably high for an industrial operation but their production costs have absolutely gone up.


The avian flu thing is another big part of this. Industrial meat brids are slaughtered at around 42 days. You're 3 weeks away from fertilized eggs hatching and 6 more weeks away from slaughter. Laying birds take months before they start producing. 0-5ish months is basically all cost, then 6ish-24ish months is when your birds are productive for marketable eggs.


If you have to slaughter all the birds at a site when they're 14 months old you're losing your birds at peak production and you're losing them 10 months early. In 3 weeks + ~5 months you had planned on buying replacements but now you need to buy early and if you amortized costs across a bird's life you lost over half of its productive time.

$7/doz may still be high because you're buying at a convenience store, but there's actually difficulties in egg production that have everything to do with production costs.",2022-11-28 11:14:11,Sacramento,Sadness,0.977603554725647

There was a small supply change (something like 45 million chickens died), but there are *a lot* of chickens in America. *Ten billion* chickens almost.

"As a frequent visitor of the Safari Park, I will say that the tours are worth it and depends on what you want to see. The one that’s always on top of my list to do when possible is the deluxe caravan Safari aka the deluxe wildlife Safari. This takes you into the multi-acre field exhibits, each broken into geographical zones. The deluxe wildlife Safari is 90 minutes along, typically will take you into East Africa and Asian savanna. You’ll see white rhinos, several Antelope species ,giraffes, crowned cranes, wildebeests, and Cape buffalos in East Africa. In the Asian Savanna, you’ll have Indian rhinos, banteng which are wild cattle, a few different deer species, Nilgai, and Blackbuck which are Indian antelope species that I love. 

I truly love that Safari tour the most and I appreciate the multi-species approach as it allows for animals to have interactions with one another in their native range. 

As for other paid Safaris, the BTS tours are a solid choice as well. I’ve done tours for elephants, rhinos, and Walkabout Australia. All were fun and very informative tours. They recently combined the rhinos and elephants tour into 1 so perhaps that would be a fun one to do, I plan to do it as soon as I have extra money 😭

As for what you can do without paying extra, there’s quite a bit and you can easily kill a few hours walking around. The exhibits I think are stellar in regards to design and animals features definitely are Lion Camp, Tiger Trail, Walkabout Australia, and Condor Ridge. Lion Camp is almost 20 years old but still regarded as one of the most impeccable lion habitats in the country. Tiger Trail is very immersive, making use of its landscape and foliage to replicate an Southeast Asian jungle for both their tigers and visitors. Walkabout Australia houses the only 2 platypuses outside their native range but can be a bit hard to spot due to the lighting, there is a marsupial walking area where kangaroos and wallabies can literally walk(or hop) in front of you. And Condor Ridge showcases the work done by the Safari Park regarding local species, with the highlight being of course the California Condors. 

2 of my other favorite areas are Elephant Valley and African Forest. Elephant Valley is home to 8 elephants and will soon be getting an upgrade, making is more immersive for guests and adding onto the existing area to increase their habitat as well as introducing species like waterfowl. African Forest is a criminally underrated area that is so quaint but not without its charm. It’s filled with endangered birds and antelope species, very scenic but you can enjoy some quiet time from the busy crowds when you need it :) Some birds may be off exhibit due to Avian Influenza so you may see signage about it around the park.

"Inflation costs aren't evenly distributed. Some sectors - like clothing - have seen very little inflation. Food is a sector that's seen above-average inflation. Eggs, for example, are up ~300% since January 2022. It's not just perceived cost - these are real costs incurred in the production and distribution chain. Another huge factor is the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) that started last year and has killed over 44 million hens.

HPAI is affecting all poultry prices, which is putting demand pressure on all meat prices. (It's also the reason that every aviary at the zoo has sanitizing pads at the entrance and why the flamingos and penguins are off exhibit).

Airport food costs more because airport rent is 2-3x more than comparable commercial rent, suppliers charge more to deliver to airports, and because employment costs are higher.

&gt; Six birds in Orange County have tested positive for avian flu, according to the county’s Health Care Agency.
&gt; 
&gt; “Avian flu is present in Orange County and while the risk of transmission to humans is low, residents should stay away from any dead birds,” Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county’s public health officer, said in [an advisory](https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/oc-health-care-agency-reports-avian-flu-confirmed-orange-county-birds). “Bird flu is very contagious among birds and can sicken and even kill certain domesticated bird species including chickens, ducks and turkeys.”
&gt; 
&gt; Authorities advise people and their pets to avoid wild birds — whether dead or alive — and surfaces that may be contaminated with bird saliva or feces. They are advised to contact a healthcare provider if they or their pets become sick after being exposed to ill or dead birds and to report sick or deceased birds to [the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s website](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Laboratories/Wildlife-Health/Monitoring/Mortality-Report).
&gt; 
&gt; Signs of the disease among domesticated and wild birds include sudden death; respiratory distress; clear discharge from the eyes, nose or mouth; lethargy; disinterest in food or water; swelling of the eyes, head, wattles or combs; a discolored or bruised comb, wattle or legs; and stumbling or falling.
&gt; 
&gt; The Orange County announcement comes less than a week after Los Angeles County’s first avian flu cases of the year [were reported](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-18/bird-flu-los-angeles-county-first-case-avian-flu) as birds migrate south for winter amid a global wave of the deadly virus, known as H5N1.
&gt; 
&gt; Public health officials warn that while avian flu is not typically a threat to humans, people should take steps to avoid infection and help stop the spread of the virus.
&gt; 
&gt; The state Department of Fish and Wildlife advised hunters in particular to take action to limit their potential exposure to the virus, which has wreaked havoc among avian populations this year.
&gt; 
&gt; In the U.S., nearly 48 million birds in 43 states have died this year as avian influenza has proliferated across the country, [according to](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-commercial-backyard-flocks) the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Experts have said that number is likely a significant undercount, because many bird flu deaths are not detected or reported.
&gt; 
&gt; Poultry farms have euthanized entire flocks of chickens and turkeys this year in response to the threat, and thousands of wild birds have been killed by the virus across the U.S. As fall migration gets underway, [experts say](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-03/infectious-bird-flu-spreads-california-chickens-wild-birds) an “unprecedented” wave of death among domestic and wild bird populations is spreading south, including to Southern California.
&gt; 
&gt; Health authorities urge Californians who encounter sick or dead birds to file a report with the California Department of Public Health’s dedicated web portal [at this link](https://westnile.ca.gov/report).",2022-10-25 07:58:58,OrangeCounty,Sadness,0.9947010278701782

As worried as I am for all the birds, it’s very scary to think about H5N1 mutating and becoming a human to human respiratory illness. The more it spreads, the more opportunities for mutation.

"You really dont understand chemistry and the refining process do you.... Gasoline and Diesel are made from the same general product, Crude Oil. Gasoline and Diesel are made at different temperatures, have different chemical compositions as well as different specific gravities. There are 2 distinct methods to make Gasoline and Diesel, they are just made with the same natural product, Crude Oil.

The reason Diesel prices are higher than gas prices is because (partially) due to demand. Gasoline is used more in the US versus Diesel. Therefore, Oil/Gas companies make less Diesel than Gasoline and therefore prices go slightly higher as there is less supply.

You also dont understand how supply and demand work. There is a limited amount of supply of Natural Gas (not a derivative of Crude Oil, this is something different). The local Gas company has to buy this from Oil/Gas companies who are charging this higher rate. The local gas company is then delivering these increases to us. To be fair, the local Gas Companies were very transparent in the fact that temporary price increases were coming.

The same thing is currently happening with Eggs. Supply is significantly down due to Avian Flu. So prices go up. It sucks but nothing we can do about it....

&amp;#x200B;

While there may be some price gouging, specifically by the oil companies, Supply is way down. And that is always going to cause price increases. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do. The government back in the day decided to make utilities privatized and the consumers have been suffering for years because of this. If utilities were still run by the government, we definitely wouldnt be seeing this stuff occuring, but who knows what other problems may have come because of that (i.e. slow response times, corrupton, etc.)

"&gt;Any trip to the grocery store does not fit the narrative that inflation has gone down. You name it; everything has doubled or tripled in cost. Eggs, if you can find them, have tripled in price; chicken and meat, the same. If inflation has come down, no evidence of it has appeared on the West Coast.

Inflation going down doesn't mean prices will go down.  That would require deflation, which can be even worse than inflation.  Inflation going down just means the rate of the price increases is falling, thus prices are still increasing, just at, you know, a slower rate.  Also, it's not like everything in the economy happens at instant speed.  The price adjustments have to work their way through the entire economy.  While prices are stabilizing for some things, other things are still catching up to the current inflated prices.  Finally, local factors can alter the prices of commodities in a particular locale.  For instance, egg prices are high because an outbreak of bird flu is causing us to cull egg-laying hen populations, so our egg prices are going to be higher for until the egg-laying hen population returns to normal levels, increasing egg supplies.  I would suspect the price of chicken would be increasing for the same reasons.",2023-02-17 10:15:32,SantaBarbara,Sadness,0.647421658039093

"**[Human mortality from H5N1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mortality_from_H5N1)** 
 
 &gt;Human mortality from H5N1 or the human fatality ratio from H5N1 or the case-fatality rate of H5N1 refer to the ratio of the number of confirmed human deaths resulting from confirmed cases of transmission and infection of H5N1 to the number of those confirmed cases. For example, if there are 100 confirmed cases of humans infected with H5N1 and 10 die, then there is a 10% human fatality ratio (or mortality rate). H5N1 flu is a concern due to the global spread of H5N1 that constitutes a pandemic threat. The majority of H5N1 flu cases have been reported in southeast and east Asia.

&gt; Iowa poultry farms prepare for highly-contagious bird flu.

&gt; Poultry farms in Iowa are watching closely, as the highly-contagious bird flu spreads across at least seven states on the east coast.

&gt; An avian flu outbreak in 2015 cost Iowa almost 8,500 jobs and more than $1 billion in economic activity, according to a study commissioned by the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation.

&gt; ""I mean, it's tough on them.""It's believed the virus is spread through migratory birds, which means Iowa could see cases later in the season.

"It kills the birds and jumps to pigs, then humans you know those times where a lot of people die from the flu. That's because bird flu jumps from pigs to humans and presents with antigens that the majority of the public do not have immunity to. You cook your meat, but novel flu strains will cook our population. And those nut jobs at the beginning of COVID saying the regular flu is deadlier than COVID we're right when we talk about bird flus that make the leap.

Also, they don't even have to make the leap directly. Influenza virus does this really cool thing in host tissues where they can recombine their genetic info with other strains of flu in those hosts so even if the bird flu strain does not make the jump, the proteins that make it scary can.

But the largest concern is that it kills birds. If birds die you.cant fucking cook them and eat them. As such, poultry producers are required to kill flocks that even a single bird tests positive in. That can be millions of birds in a flock. That means millions in losses for the company and, well. No chicken on the store shelves.

I'd be 1000x less worried about this if a general influenza vaccine saw wide adoption.

"This is an awful post about the bird flu and what's going on with it. It makes it seem like the chickens were burned alive. That's not true. 

Also carbon monoxide is very humane. The birds just go to sleep. They don't suffer. 

The have to burn the chickens after death to stop the spread. They virus can be spread from dead chickens. If another bird ate a carcus that had the flu, they could get the virus then pass it on to other birds. It's not just a chicken virus. It's effecting geese, ducks, pheasant etc. 

Also the difference between 2015 and now is that the virus started as highly pathogenic where as 2015 it started as low and moved to high during transmission. So the virus is very much worse now than before. This is probably why they suggested other jobs to workers. Trying to repopulate barns is difficult. You can't merge 2 flocks for fear one could have the virus. There's more biosecurity measures involved now. And trying to get pullets that are ready are expensive and take time. Sometimes months or even up to a year.

They also could have suggested other jobs if Rembrandt is remodeling barns. Egg facilities have to go to cage free systems. So if they decided they are going to remodel during the bird flu epidemic, they don't need laborers to manage birds.

"This is the more important part of the legislation, and the part they need to be leaning into harder:  


""When natural disasters like bird flu and extreme weather strike, industrial livestock operations incur huge losses.

The Industrial Agriculture Accountability Act shifts the burden to where it belongs: the backs of Big Agribusiness.""  


Historically the smaller family farms were naturally more humane and more environmentally friendly, not in a hardcore environmentalist kind of way, but their operations were just naturally less destructive, and they fished the waterways and their kids drank from the wells. The problem is the big industrial operations, which need regulated, and the state legislature desperately needs to get off it's ass and look at taxing commercial operations whose owners don't live in the state or even the country at a higher rate to give local operations a better chance.",2022-11-24 08:47:02,Iowa,Sadness,0.9552765488624572

"Bird flu is a huge problem. They can have over 70% mortality, and a single Sparrow can take it from one coupe to the next. Then with millions of infected chickens you risk that one of them mutates just enough for the flu to make the jump to humans.

So it's 50% the flu, and 50% greed because the corporations know they can get away with raising prices.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/01/13/business/egg-prices-cal-maine-foods/index.html",2023-01-21 19:38:17,Iowa,Sadness,0.674075186252594
"1. you're mistaking the why. They do not want to set a timeline because then there is a burden for the patient to 'prove' that they fit the very narrow guidelines. We saw clearly with the Cox case how women are treated when their health is in danger. This doesn't mean they actually happen during those later weeks. Less than 1% of all abortions are late term. Women in general would not carry a fetus for 8 months just to abort. That doesnt make any sense and is why the vast majority of them happen early on.

2. Being impoverished and in danger is a valid reason to seek asylum, which again, you used to be able to do at any crossing. We helped create the system that left these nations impoverished. We profited from it. It's our responsibility to deal with this in a humane way. 

3. Biden isn't responsible for the inflation, and he isn't responsible for it going down now. Even the egg industry, which had a valid reason to raise prices due to bird flu, artificially inflated their prices. Every study i have read has admitted that corporate greed has contributed significantly to this pricing. Otherwise...how would you explain that many of these companies that have inflated their products have also posted record profits?

4. Are you a medical professional that has the credentials to decide that gender dysphoria, and by extension, transgenderism is a mental illness? Because the DSM is the authority on that and I doubt you even know what that is. Just because you are ignorant, doesn't mean something is wrong with them.

"Iowa was where the bulk of the avian flu occurred. Those damned pigeons really do carry diseases, along with red-wing black birds, black birds, wrens, sparrows, etc.

Millions of laying hens throughout the nation have been culled in an attempt to stop the disease from spreading.

Of course, it does not take that long to replace laying hens since little chicks can be bred pretty fast into adult laying hens again.

If egg prices don't go down in a year, you will know that this was a premeditated conspiracy to keep prices high. Monopolizing egg production and distribution will do that. It allows a few big players in any one market sector to essentially control prices for maximum profits.

This is no different than the oil market jacking up gas prices and yet no one ran out of gas, there were no lines, there was no shortage of gas.

I remember 1973 and the Arab oil embargo. That was a real shortage of gas. Gas stations ran out. Gas lines went for a mile at gas stations that had gas. The economy shut down due to lack of supplies being transported.

No predators in any environment (even an unnatural one like a city) can create a bad situation.

I just think they are not behaving like geese and may end up being injured by this.

I think eventually there is an overpopulation problem.  Looking at how well they have rebounded and how quickly this is a guess on my part.  In a city / suburban setting and with a law prohibiting (generally although Iowa DNR has exceptions available to them) human intervention other than simple discouragement there can come a time where disease threatens the geese and possibly other species as well.  Should they for example become impacted by the avian flu it will be bad for their population - overall.

"6 kids...1 @ St Lukes, 2 @ Mercy, 3 @ UofI

St Lukes (unity point) - Dedicated birthing building...lots of curb appeal, lots of snob appeal. Our birthing nurse was amazing. Born in an ice storm, so she stayed quite awhile. After she left it all went to shit. Every other nurse was competing either for the beeotch-supreme award or the biggest shoulder shrug trophy. Granted it was our first time, but lactation difficulties, and a collicky baby left us needing some help. They just kept repeating ""have you tried feeding him?"". Yes, yes, and four more times after that, yes. Never once offered supplementary formula. Never once offered anything besides have you tried feeding him and/or shoulder shrugs. Literal f'ing shoulder shrugs. It didnt get any better until our peditrician showed up and started bossing nurses around. Baby lost more weight than it should have...but why not, he was starving...our fault of course...why you ask? ...*shoulder shrug*

Side note -  Before baby #2 we did a pre visit at St lukes and Mercy. They were so beeotchy during the visit it was clear how it was going to go so we went with Mercy. This all happened during some lame lesser bird flu outbreak in Canada or some such nonsense so all birth suites regardless of hospital were saying no more than 2 'visitors'. A buddy of mine had a baby at St lukes during that time. Grandparents came for a visit, he went out to the waiting room to get them...they wouldnt let all 3 go back...Dad isnt dad, he is a visitor. Stupid, but fine. He tried to wait in the waiting room, hospital staff said he couldnt wait in building, had to go outside. Dude was wearing panjama bottoms and a tshirt - it was dead of winter. Asked if he could get his coat? Nope, leave before we call security. Doesnt want to cause trouble, stands outside as close to door as possible so he can catch a little warmth. Security comes out and makes him stand on the far side of the driveway. So he cant cantaminate the building he was just in. He got wise real quick...bundled up and put a lawn chair outside the suite window so he could still be part of the experience and see his parents see the baby for the first time and such. Meanwhile, Mercy at that time counted Dad as dad and I got to be in the room even with 2 visitors :)

Mercy - 2 babies, amazing experiences with both. Dad got treated like a human being instead of a nuisance. Mom got taken care of very well - still a little trouble lactating? How about we try some supplementary formula! Oh snap - baby was past birth weight when we left, everyone got more sleep, not one single nurse shrugged at me...not one! Every time there was a question there was an answer or an attempt to find an answer! Food was indeed good. Couldnt have been happier with Mercy and had 2 children there!

...wife decided along the way that she wanted to try all-natural, and wanted to use a mid-wife program instead of the ob-gyn. So, the next 3...

UofI (midwife program) - efficient, we were driving a bit and waited too long. Baby #5 came out 4 minutes after arrival, no one but the closest nurse in the room...still went just fine :) Overall, I would compare as very close to Mercy...slightly more clinical astetics, Mercy was more cozy, but otherwise fine. UofI is a research hospital, so they will ask for permission to bring students in and allow them to do rudimentary tasks and check ups after the birth. I always said yes, I kinda liked having a gaggle of people looking after my kid as opposed to our st lukes experience.

And there isn't just one singular cause of it, it's multi-systemic, though a major root of the problem is ""capitalism"" and the way it sets up society in an exploitative and alienating fashion. Over the past roughly half a century or so in America, but elsewhere as well, we've seen this accelerate. There have been some partial advancements here and there, but we've also seen massive increases in inequality; massive growth of unchecked power of the wealthy and powerful; demonization of the poor and the sick; destruction of community and increasing alienation; and so on.

This whole crisis has accelerated substantially over the last decade and continues to ramp up year over year. You have massive assaults on civil liberties and free expression; on the concept of an open and inclusive society; on the very foundations of democracy. In the US we have seen this very clearly with the GOP making a long-term play to undermine democracy in multiple ways. First through the use of gerrymandering and voter suppression at the state level, then even more extreme measures culminating with a half-organized attempt to execute a coup last year. And all of this may sound far fetched and unbelievable but this is the reality of the world we live in, and it doesn't change being real just because it sounds extreme, it *is* extreme, but it's the truth. The truths of project REDMAP and of *intentional* voter suppression are well documented, even The Economist downgraded the US to a ""flawed democracy"". And this is part of a larger trend across the world, a world where democracy is a shadow of what it was and where most major world powers are controlled by aggressive extremists is very much a possibility in the next few years.

Meanwhile, the governments and institutions that exist at present are today substantially in crisis. Many of them are crumbling or being actively deconstructed by powerful hostile forces. Many of them do not serve the public interest well, many of them are corrupt, many of them have shown that they are not up to the challenge of the present moment. In the 20th century there were many, many challenges that society faced but even though there were many failures there were also many successes. In 1900 the average American didn't have indoor plumbing or electricity, antibiotics didn't exist, and you had a pretty iffy chance of even surviving to adulthood due to the omnipresence of different diseases and environmental hazards, but there were vast improvements over the 20th century. Lately we've been coasting on those gains and ignoring the continuing work that needs to be done.

Today we are faced with innumerable other crises that require enormous civilizational level investments to tackle but the elites and the powerful are largely not on board with putting in the work. We have numerous ways in which things like our land and water use and the way we grow food are not sustainable. And this has been a crisis brewing from well over a century ago. In the American Southwest water use has never been sustainable, and it's been clear that we are just operating on borrowed time. And yet despite that obviousness and the fact that the systems we put in place to manage those resources have been obviously broken and obviously corrupt for *decades* we haven't put in the work to tackle those problems. Those in power have largely been complacent, hoping that the disaster will blow up in the next generation's face instead of theirs. Well, we're finally getting to that blow up.

This is, of course, hugely compounded by climate change. Another slow rolling disaster which was apparent on the horizon even in the mid-20th century but has been met consistently mostly by complacency by our power structures and governments. Which isn't to say that we haven't made some progress on it, but we haven't made anywhere near enough. Either in terms of the damage to the environment that is done by our activities or to building a society and an economy that is resilient to the inevitable damage that will result from climate change. And now those chickens are coming home to roost. We are seeing decade by decade, year by year, day by day, and hour by hour how these hypotheticals and these predictions for ""the future"" are translating into practicals for the present. We have experienced smoke season year after year in Seattle (which, illustratively, is the result of a combination of the impact of climate change making wildfires more severe and harder to control along with poor land management). Last year we had the life threatening period of the heat dome in the PNW, a story that we are now watching play out elsewhere across the globe in different areas and different times year after year (this year it's India/Pakistan and then the middle east, though now there's a crazy series of heat waves in the midwest and northeast). We've watched the looming drought develop in California and the Southwest. We've watched the record breaking floods and tornadoes and hurricanes. We recognize fully that we are in that shitty part of the post-apocalyptic movie during the starting credits where news stories are playing and explaining how the apocalypse began and we don't like that feeling at all.

And we see the same pattern. The public is overwhelmingly onboard with dedicating sufficient resources to tackle these problems like any responsible civilization should. And yet, our government continues to do next to nothing, in stark repudiation of the public will and public *necessity*. This is not a tenable situation.

Then we have the pandemic (for future readers this refers to covid-19, not bird flu or monkeypox), which has been mishandled by most governments of most developed countries. It's great that we got vaccines fairly quickly but that's not enough, what we needed was more societal support for public health. We needed people to understand that when it was necessary to do large scale lockdowns they would be married with support (in the form of food and other vital services and potentially housing as well) for the duration necessary. We needed to be able to have a society that drove down disease incidence to a level where it could then be kept under control through track and trace efforts, the way many other dangerous infectious diseases are. But we didn't get that. Instead we got a chaotic piecemeal approach that left us with a combination of years of partially enforced and partially effective restrictions and years of wave after wave after wave of disease.

And I haven't even covered America's policing crisis. Folks have awareness of all of these things whether they understand their causes and details or not. People perceive the alienation and the hatred that has been fermented and fomented in America for decades. We live in a culture that produces suicide murderers as a casual byproduct. These are just an everyday occurrence in America which don't even ping the radar unless more than a handful of people die. Our society is sick on a grand scale, and these are the obvious symptoms of it. Individually we might be able to protect ourselves against this sickness through robust support networks made up of our friends, family, coworkers, maybe our personal wealth, etc, but for those without such physical or interpersonal resources to fall back on there is no protection from the reality that we live in a harsh dehumanizing hellscape.

Meanwhile, all of these vast global level crises (the climate disaster, the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the threat of WW3, etc.) causes people to think more deeply about value and meaning in their own lives. They step back and realize that they have substantially been abused and misused by society and specifically by our economic system. We work in demoralizing jobs that give us limited autonomy and limited slivers of time in which to be ourselves and to properly live. And we don't like it. We wonder ""what's the fucking point of spending all this time working for others just to pay rent and feed ourselves when the apocalypse is looming"". And that forces us to re-evaluate the value of everything we do or are forced to do regardless of how closely the threat of death and destruction looms, because everyone of us will die eventually, and whether that's next year or a few decades away the question of how we spend that precious coin of the time we have to live is still critically important. Increasingly people have been unsatisfied not just with how they are spending their time but more so with the options given to them. It used to be that it was much easier to make some sacrifices in terms of your standard of living to open up opportunities for making big changes in your life (going to school to change careers or pursuing personal projects or simply giving yourself more free time and more autonomy by living more humbly) but slowly year by year those opportunities have been swept away and lost for average folks. Increasingly people have gotten locked into lives they have limited control over. You can't change careers or take a break because you're saddled with student loan debt or high rent. And increasingly people end up stuck in lives where they just wonder what the point of even existing is. When you see horrors happening routinely (race massacres in US cities, crimes against humanity in Ukraine, the climate apocalypse looming, the rollback of civil rights, a million Americans dead from covid, etc.) you really start to question the value of the life you're living right now and what it even means to live a rewarding life and you start to wonder how doing so in the near-future is going to even be possible for you and your loved ones.

"They gassed like 50 million chickens and turkeys this month for bird flu, are the thinking people going to attend to that?",2022-05-26 02:35:47,Seattle,Anger,0.9919731616973876
"H5N1 is a flu strain, and more specifically references highly pathogenic avian influenza (bird flu) which has been ripping through wild and domesticated bird populations around the world over the last few years and has hit a substantial uptick this year especially as it has migrated to the Americas, resulting in hundreds of millions of birds that have been killed by the flu or culled in an attempt to keep it from spreading.

So far this strain has been very rare in humans, with cases being limited to individuals who work closely with birds. However, it has a high mutation rate as all flu strains do, as well as being subject to standard flu strain creation mechanisms. So the worry that a strain which is as transmissible person to person as typical human flu strains are is a serious potentiality. So far this strain has a roughly 30-80% case fatality rate in humans, which is, uh, let's call it eye opening, though there's a lot of variables involved.

The bad news is that the potential for a highly transmissible in humans strain of avian influenza definitely exists and could hit the world with a pandemic problem that would make covid-19 look like a walk in the park. On top of that it's devastating many bird populations and has likely already been a major factor in the extinction of some endangered bird species. Especially it has had and will continue to have a major impact on the poultry business, which just adds to the whole mess of food production and availability that's going on globally right now. And to add to that there's the even worse news that because of the nature of how immunity is acquired for the flu as well as the rapid evolution of flu viruses vaccines just aren't terribly good.

If you asked an infectious disease expert in, say, 2018 what they were worried about in terms of the next pandemic in humans they would have told you the flu, specifically the H5N1 strain, but we ended up getting hit by a different bullet, this time.

If you've got a sinking feeling in your gut now, here comes the good news. In the last few years education and control efforts have reduced the number of human cases of H5N1 from a high of dozens of cases per year in the early 2010s to just a handful a year in the late 2010s and then to incredibly isolated incidents in the last few years. Also, spread of the flu is highly controllable by wearing a mask in public, limiting exposure, and washing your hands. Such measures are much more effective against the flu than covid, so much so that the precautions over the last two years may have resulted in a few previously circulating flu strains to go extinct. So there are effective means of control if a deadly flu strain did pop up.",2022-05-28 16:38:41,Seattle,Joy,0.99278461933136

"Thanks for asking! Biotech is short for biotechnology - the simplest definition of biotechnology is “using living things to make a product”. 

So things like beer &amp; wine (yeast is a living organism that ferments sugar into alcohol and bubbles) and even dairy cows are technically “biotechnology”!

The term is most-often used in the context of medicine, though. I use living things (single-celled organisms similar to yeast) to make medicines. My team and I are essentially brewers, except we brew drugs instead of beer.

So what do we /actually do/? A lot of our time is spent fine-tuning the growth conditions of our little organism farm (time, temperature, gas mixture, food, etc.) to maximize the amount and quality of drugs we produce. We feed and nourish our single-celled livestock daily, we rigorously test our single-celled livestock for agents like viruses and bacteria (check out the press about bird flu in dairy cows), and we develop technology that enables us to to all of the above more efficiently so high-quality medicines can make it to patients quickly *and* safely.

TL;DR I farm single-celled organisms; my tiny livestock makes drugs.",2024-05-09 00:19:48,Seattle,Sadness,0.961050271987915

Animal-to-human transmission may occur by bite or scratch, bush meat preparation, direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, or indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated bedding. **Human-to-human transmission is thought to occur primarily through large respiratory droplets**.

Mind your bodily fluid exposures, avoid contact with someone's blood, use protection with sex with strangers, wash your hands, wear a mask around strangers indoors, you'll probably be fine.

The only way this'll go badly is if the public completely ignores sensible precautions and goes crazy and the government completely mishandles the response.

"&gt; Do you have sources for this? That case fatality rate is extreme!

Stats are on wikipedia (with sources): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1#Transmission_and_host_range

The cases are kind of all over the place so it's very hard to generalize case fatality rates, especially as the cases range over a huge diversity of countries in terms of economic and development levels. But overall fatality rates are shockingly high.

&gt; &gt; ""...as well as the rapid evolution of flu viruses vaccines just aren't terribly good.""

&gt; Agreed. Due to the rate of antigentic variation, right?

Partly, but it's actually much worse than that due to quirks in the human immune system which are aggravated with the flu. There's a phenomenon which has been given the name [original antigenic sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin) which basically results in your immune system plowing whatever furrow it previously did when it comes to tackling a particular disease or even set of diseases (though there's a lot of complexities here I'm glossing over for simplicity's sake). And this can lead to weak immunity depending on differences between the strain you first acquired immunity against and a later strain. For the flu what happens is that you end up with stronger immunity against the type of flu strain you were first exposed to, and weak immunity to certain other variations. Because your immune system can't ""lose"" against the inactivated flu virus in the vaccine it's not going to learn that it's weak immunity against a particular strain wasn't enough, it's just going to intensify that weak immunity rather than switch antigenic targets to something more effective.

In short this means that there can be a limit to how effective a flu vaccine can be for a given individual when the vaccine is based off of live or dead viruses. And this could be a reason why seasonal flu vaccines are usually only modestly effective on average. However, this might be more controllable with the magic of mRNA vaccines and other advanced vaccine technologies, but we are only just beginning to put in the work there and it may take years to pay off.

So the other good news is that potentially within the next couple of years we could see some highly effective mRNA based universal flu vaccines introduced, and these could be broadly protective against seasonal flu and new pandemic flu strains that might pop up, including H5N1 variants.",2022-05-28 17:43:41,Seattle,Sadness,0.9938947558403016

Sudden death with no prior signs
Low energy or appetite
Purple discoloration or swelling of various body parts
Reduced egg production, or soft-shelled/misshapen eggs
Nasal discharge, coughing, or sneezing
Lack of coordination
Diarrhea

"Hey y’all! Your local stranding network volunteer here! I figured since this post has gotten pretty popular, I should chime in :) 

So in a situation like this, the best thing to do would be to get out of the water and away from the animal. It may just be curious, it could be feeling territorial, but regardless of the motives of the seal (and those big puppy dog eyes luring you in for a cuddle) it’s still a wild animal weighing anywhere from 200-300lbs, 5-6’ long, armed with sharp teeth and sharp claws on it’s flippers, and an infinitely better swimmer than you could ever hope to be. You don’t want to be on its bad side! Pupping season hasn’t started yet so there are no babies or juveniles out in the water, only adults. Juveniles and pups are just as much of a risk to a human, they possess the same teeth and claws, the same diseases, just in a smaller package. 

I can’t personally recall reports of seals harassing and injuring swimmers in Whatcom county waters off the top of my head, but a seal DID harass and [bite a swimmer](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/very-very-rare-woman-recovering-after-being-bitten-by-seal-san-juan-islands/3VEKPLDNBZCCZLGOFPDTFQA2KI/?outputType=amp) this summer off San Juan Island. This is NOT a common occurrence by any means but it’s also something you want to avoid. 

It’s absolutely not worth the risk of injury to your self or the risk of habituating the animal to human interaction. If the animal becomes too comfortable approaching humans, it puts this animal in danger. Not everyone shares the “cute water puppy” sentiment and there are some people with very strong opinions on harbor seals who will not respond kindly to being approached.

There are some VERY serious health risks involved in interacting with seals. The greatest concern is HPAI (avian influenza). This virus is present in harbor seals in Washington state &amp; is NOT something you want to catch. There’s also the very serious risk of “seal finger” - a very aggressive, difficult to treat bacterial infection that can come from seal bites or interaction with pinnipeds when you have an open wound. It can take months to treat &amp; cause permanent damage to the infected area. Here are some articles on guidelines for interaction with seals given the current HPAI outbreak &amp; info on seal finger.

Just to be clear, in this state, right now, 40% of households with a child under 6 years of age are living with housing insecurity. Why? Because she subsidizes major employers to keep wages low. People might be employed but they are underemployed, earning less than is necessary to afford this housing market. 

WA 5th district has some of the highest increases in housing costs in the nation. Spokane Valley has seen a 25% in the last 12 months. Wages are not keeping pace.      

Her inflation is down comment doesn't make a lot of sense to me. It sure does not seem like inflation is down to me, but I notice when eggs are $6 (bird flu), the same dog food is twice as much as it used to be, and the same groceries cost more today than they did last year. The rate of inflation might be down but prices are NOT.

"I would contact animal control for your county and then I would contact Dept of Fish and Wildlife. You have to document document document everything.

Don't touch dead or sick birds. Avian flu is spreading and while there is no proven human to human transmission yet they death rate has been about 1 in 20 so far.,2024-07-21 10:19:20,Everett,Fear,0.9229451417922974
"Not sure what's causing it. Might even just be a bit of bad luck finding dead animals... do be extra careful around unwell birds though! H5n1 is still making it's way through bird populations and, occasionally, infects people",2024-07-21 09:52:10,Everett,Anger,0.8843725323677063
