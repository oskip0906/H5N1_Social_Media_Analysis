""While feeders do lead to a congregation of wild birds, feeding isn't considered a significant HPAI driver,"" said Travis Lau, the communications director for the Pennsylvania Game Commission. ""The birds most affected don't often visit feeders.""

Also, vultures do not visit bird feeders either, nor are they closely related to song birds. If anything, they may be feasting on dead and dying backyard and/or large farm chickens not properly disposed of that are carrying Avian Flu, which would be a much bigger concern because chickens, like many fowl, are very susceptible to it.

It was probably one of those things where a real supply shock (avian flu in some parts of the country) lead to panic buying and then just as quickly a drop off in sales so supply and prices could go back to normal.,2023-02-21 08:18:24,philadelphia,Fear,0.9603644609451294,Topic 11,0.40451991747794525
Unfortunately all the trails in the area are closed right now due to avian flu outbreak. You can still watch the eagles hunt though. I was just there this morning lol.,2023-04-09 16:08:30,philadelphia,Fear,0.7150289416313171,Topic 5,0.3535533905932737
Possibly avian flu; don’t handle and maybe report,2023-07-09 15:36:55,philadelphia,Fear,0.9603021740913392,Topic 18,0.35355339059327373
This wasn’t the answer though. We went in 2021 when all the outside birds were first brought inside. It was because of avian flu. I think the birds died or they got rid of them. They had new meerkats recently and they also all died from some mysterious virus. The bears are leaving this year as well. I just don’t think the people there upkeep anymore.,2024-05-10 13:52:29,philadelphia,Fear,0.563129723072052,Topic 8,0.4213324203089069
"That man, while doing a valuable public service, singlehandedly killed the pretzel industry.

I don't even give a fuck if I get avian flu from birds pecking at them either. 

Ice cold coke and a piss pretzel.

"I don't see how my comment lacked nuance, but let me try again...

The real problem is that COVID is not a *major* virus, but it's also not a *minor* virus. A *major* viral pandemic would be something like H5N1 (the one most of us in the research community have been worried about for the last decade-and-a-half). The case fatality rate of H5N1 is close to 60%...so we wouldn't be talking about millions of dead, but more like *billions* of dead.

At the same time, COVID's case fatality rate is still greater than *literally any other currently circulating disease*. It's greater than HIV (with modern treatments). Without vaccination it's greater than malaria. Even *with* vaccination it's in the same ballpark as malaria, and malaria has a much more limited range. 2 years into the pandemic, and the statistics just recently released show that for those age 45-54, COVID was the leading cause of death in the US...more than cancer, more than heart disease, more than car accidents.

So, calling COVID ""minor"" depends heavily on how you define that term. If I asked you if a 1% case fatality rate was ""minor"", maybe you'd say yes. In that case, COVID, at a case fatality rate of somewhere between 0.1% and 0.05% would qualify as ""minor"".

But would you call the communicable disease with the highest case fatality rate of any disease currently circulating in the human population ""minor""?

...I guess it's all relative.",2022-07-16 01:25:49,philadelphia,Sadness,0.9593511819839478,Topic 8,0.19103826717285077
"Did you read the article you posted?  Where it talks about the specific reasons behind the prices and shortages for that specific area, such as the nationwide bird flu epidemic that killed off a large portion of the chicken population, or the proposition that passed in, again, *California* that put guidelines in place for how many chickens could be raised with a certain amount of farmland?

Which of those was Biden most responsible for, would you say?",2023-08-03 13:52:06,Erie,Anger,0.9061467051506042,Topic 12,0.3182738941971923
