"I don't see how my comment lacked nuance, but let me try again...

The real problem is that COVID is not a *major* virus, but it's also not a *minor* virus. A *major* viral pandemic would be something like H5N1 (the one most of us in the research community have been worried about for the last decade-and-a-half). The case fatality rate of H5N1 is close to 60%...so we wouldn't be talking about millions of dead, but more like *billions* of dead.

At the same time, COVID's case fatality rate is still greater than *literally any other currently circulating disease*. It's greater than HIV (with modern treatments). Without vaccination it's greater than malaria. Even *with* vaccination it's in the same ballpark as malaria, and malaria has a much more limited range. 2 years into the pandemic, and the statistics just recently released show that for those age 45-54, COVID was the leading cause of death in the US...more than cancer, more than heart disease, more than car accidents.

So, calling COVID ""minor"" depends heavily on how you define that term. If I asked you if a 1% case fatality rate was ""minor"", maybe you'd say yes. In that case, COVID, at a case fatality rate of somewhere between 0.1% and 0.05% would qualify as ""minor"".

But would you call the communicable disease with the highest case fatality rate of any disease currently circulating in the human population ""minor""?
