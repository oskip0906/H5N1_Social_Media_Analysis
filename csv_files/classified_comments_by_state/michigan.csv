"This is something that I've been keeping close tabs on because we raise our own ducks and geese.

This particular strain has been going through bird flocks from Asia to Europe and now to the US and North America like wildfire. Waterfowl apparently don't show any symptoms, just mysteriously die. Dryland birds like chickens and turkeys show symptoms but die quickly, and the entire flock gets very sick very fast and often dies off within days. It is only jumped to a couple of people, and they were ones who worked closely with sick animals in not so clean conditions. The odds of this bird flu jumping to humans at this point, I think, is pretty low given that it has been spreading around the world with migrating birds and affected many small flocks and commercial flocks as well. A whole lot of humans have been exposed with no sickness. It also does not seem to be jumping to other mammals.

The infected flock in Michigan is a homestead flock not far from me, and there are a lot of us in Southwest Michigan who have small flocks. We are keeping our birds inside their duck yard when we have been allowing them to free-range. They are recommending that people keep their birds either inside a coop that cannot be infiltrated by wild birds or do what they can to keep food and water away from wild birds and follow serious biohazard protocols. Gloves only for the barn, boots only used in the barn, stuff like that.

"Feels mean, but yes.  Feeders are potentially worse than deer baiting in terms of spreading respiratory illnesses.  Birds aren't limited by geography nearly as much as deer, so the couple robin that stop off at a feeder could easily cover a few miles in the air to reach a local chicken or turkey farm that has huge amounts of food littering the floors to either catch or spread whatever version is floating around right now.

"Industry concentration can certainly be a factor, but are you contending that the concentration of power you cite as the cause of higher egg prices only came into being during the pandemic, and wasn't present before? 

Because eggs at Aldi were like $0.88/dozen pre-pandemic and its associated stimulative economic measures. In fact, at one point in 20198 or 2019 they were under $0.50/dozen at Aldi and I joked that the birds might go on strike. Then they got up to the $4 - $5 range, and now are $2.xx. 

These prices don't seem to correlate well with the degree of concentration in the industry. Was concentration really low in 2019, really high in 2022 and now decreasing again in 2023?

Or is it more reasonable to look at market issues like avian flu, seasonal demand patterns, and feed and transportation costs?


&gt; **Why are egg prices so high?**

&gt;Since the start of 2022, highly pathogenic avian influenza has led to the deaths of about 58 million birds. It is the deadliest outbreak of all time and the worst one since 2015, when 50 million birds were culled, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data.

&gt;U.S. egg inventories were 29% lower in the final week of December 2022 than at the beginning of 2022, according to the USDA. More than 43 million egg-laying hens had died as a result of the malady by the end of December. 

&gt;“Lower-than-usual shell egg inventories near the end of the year, combined with increased demand stemming from the holiday baking season, resulted in several successive weeks of record-high egg prices,” USDA economists said in a January research note.

&gt;Egg prices have also increased as part of overall food inflation driven by rising costs of labor, ingredients and logistics. Higher feed and transportation costs for producers mean shoppers will continue to face elevated egg prices even when the bird flu’s effects diminish, said CoBank ‘s Mr. Earnest.

"Farmers get tax breaks and such, but the industry is setting farmers up for failure. I’ll provide a link to an article that highlights common struggles in dairy farming, but there are issues in other segments of farming as well. Plant based large-scale farmers are typically under contract to purchase specific seed, and the seed is usually modified so they aren’t able to save seed from harvest to replant, meaning they always have to buy seed; oftentimes crops are grown in soils that are exhausted due to industrial farming, so they also are forced to purchase fertilizer; with the changing weather patterns, after these expenses sometimes crops even fail and then they make no money. In a lot of situations, farmers get very little profit off of their goods, which puts them in a cycle of debt and poverty, like the article states about the family owing hundreds of thousands of dollars on used farm equipment. There are tons of facets. I mean, some farmers now have to kill their entire flocks of chickens because of avian flu, that’s a huge financial loss. In summary I think industrial farming just isn’t working for our changing climate and for our consumer system that’s screwing not only the farmer, but the land. Here’s the article, but feel free to google a bit more and find more info for non-dairy farmers - it’s rampant and has kept me away from my dream idea of owning a farm.
