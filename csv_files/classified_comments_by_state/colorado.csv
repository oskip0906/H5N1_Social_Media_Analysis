"Avian Flu is **extremely rare** to be detected in any sort of North American songbird/backyard bird. How rare? It has been observed twice. Ever.



* A single Cooper’s Hawk reported in Wisconsin. 


* A single Blue Jay in Nova Scotia tested positive.



* *Maybe* a crow to really stretch it. Not confirmed. 



The role of songbirds in avian flu is just a big scientific gap. No one really knows for *absolute certain*. Surveillance isn't huge, and that's because we know they aren't a major factor. Right now there is no evidence to suggest songbirds play any real role in the spread of avian flu.


As of this week there have been [5 detected cases of avian flu in Colorado.](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nwhc/science/avian-influenza-surveillance?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objectsOne) 1 backyard chicken flock, and 4 wild water fowl.



[Here](https://www.birdwatchingdaily.com/news/conservation/avian-flu-infects-at-least-34-north-american-bird-species/) is every known North American bird species (34) that can be infected / carry Avian flu strains. 



* Don't go messing around with dead birds. Especially waterfowl. 


* Got backyard chickens, turkey, geese, ducks, quail? Probably best not to put out a bird feeder. That seems very reasonable, just to be safe.


* Otherwise, it would be quite an *extreme* decision to avoid a bird feeder all together IMO. But you should clean them once a month any way (9 parts water to 1 part bleach). Even just to avoid mold and poop build up. 


* But if it's going to make you feel uncomfortable, theres no harm in keeping the feeders inside this year.",2022-04-16 15:02:11,Denver,Fear,0.999862790107727,Topic 8,0.1155172133472787
"https://raptor.umn.edu/about-us/our-research/HPAI

The Raptor Center has a good explanation on the unknowns related to avian flu and why you should take down bird feeders. 

""Every day at The Raptor Center, we are seeing the impact of HPAI- as we triage and test birds like bald eagles and great horned owls that are intensely suffering from fatal neurological illness due to HPAI. With these infected birds, humane euthanasia is the only tool we have left to help them. We also know that this strain and outbreak is causing severe illness in other species  like geese, ducks, blue jays, and crows.

During these unprecedented times, we recommend doing anything that we can to try and help our wild bird populations. Because the science is unclear on the role of songbirds in this current H5N1 outbreak, one consideration is to not encourage birds to gather together at places such as bird feeders or bird baths. These are places where things like viruses could easily be exchanged between individuals.

In areas with HPAI transmission in any avian species, consider pausing the use of bird feeders and baths for the next couple of months until the rate of virus transmission in wild birds dramatically decreases. Not only will this action help to protect those beautiful feathered creatures that visit your yard, but will also help all wild bird species that are already having it  hard this spring because of HPAI. We have it in our power to take a short term action so we are not accidentally assisting in the virus’ spread.  This outbreak won’t last forever and I, for one, am greatly looking forward to when I can safely hang my bird feeders back up!""",2022-04-16 15:12:47,Denver,Sadness,0.989870011806488,Topic 8,0.21029775604801498

"Avian Flu has been decimating laying operations

The answer is that supply is significantly reduced. I'm not sure I would go so far as to say there is a shortage per se, but the ""input"" side of the equation is impacted enough that a grocery store may be caught short if their buyer is not ahead of the game.

Maybe it's at the ""pre-shortage"" stage? If things continue as they are there will be chronic outages, though I don't think we've quite crossed that watershed YET we are headed that direction.

Edit: the immediate ""this week"" outage is probably a combination of things -- most notably, something like Thanksgiving converges pretty much ALL sales patterns into a single event, and it is to be expected that there would be a run on grocery stores 5-8 days later.

Most of the year you might go once a week, your neighbor every 5 days, a different neighbor twice a week, etc -- the buyer at the grocery store can more or less estimate that large-scale 'average' pattern. But a bottleneck event like Thanksgiving pinches everything into one event, which is known/obvious, but the followup is also important. People will ""run out"" at more or less the same time following the holiday and need to restock...everyone at once. If the buyer at the store did not plan for THAT convergence they could be caught flat in any case and add to that a reduction in production...and you have empty shelves.

As individual's buying patterns re-establish and spread out over the next week or two the store-level averaging patterns will re-establish themselves and you should see a return to normal.

That said, prices will continue to rise regardless until this round of the flu passes but at an industry level (not the farm level) I expect the normal sequence of hatch-raise-lay for hens will continue as they have been throughout the bird pandemic and supply should be maintained.

On a related note, the fact that sunflower prices are up (see: Ukraine/Russia, drought in the US, etc) means other oil-seeds will also rise, they tend to move as a set. Peanut, Safflower, Corn, Soy, Canola, etc. (these are all important cooking/human crops even if we don't account for animal feed). A reduced harvest of one oil-seed in a given year means consumption moves to another that, hopefully, had a better harvest in a given year. With corn and soy being common ingredients in animal feed, a small adjustment in costs would be expected even without avian flu and inflation making the rounds. (Fortunately, the cost of feed v. cost of eggs is a small impact for [reasons] but it is not zero).

Sunflower had a 15% jump wholesale in September/October after rising steadily the last year, and is expected to jump again sometime over the next year because European distributors are reportedly sitting on inventory due to the uncertainties related to the war in Ukraine. Many American harvests were impacted by drought this year, and now with the Mississippi being at record lows shipping from the Midwest -&gt; sea ports is nearly as hampered as the shipments in Ukraine, only difference is who is to blame. Domestic shipments can be done by rail of course, but price is still impacted dramatically.",2022-12-02 12:51:19,Denver,Sadness,0.999295711517334,Topic 12,0.11846977555181851

Does regulation that draws attention to the source of eggs make people reconsider their choices to eat eggs in the first place?

How do they decide who gets the eggs they do have? Whoever is willing to pay the most, so the producers don't lose as much money. The grocery stores want to make sure they have some amount of eggs on hand, to prevent customers from heading to a competitor store this week for groceries in which case they lose out on the customer's money for milk, bread, meat, cereal, pasta, etc. Buuutttt, they're not exactly willing to take a loss on the price of eggs.

"With poultry, given the commonality of wild birds being primary vector for disease, the control of battery cage environment reduces spread of avian influenza. This is reflected in the academic literature. 

Of course there are mitigants in either environment, but perhaps counterintuitively, the proximity of mass-produced birds / eggs does not make the spread of avian flu more likely than if the birds are cage free and exposed to more environmental factors. 

In a sentence: the risk associated with close proximity in an industrial setting is outweighed by the inefficiency of biosecurity in a less controlled, or cage-free, etc. setting.

This is incorrect. Genetic remnants cannot be grown into active virus. 

The qPCR analysis helps determine if the virus has been in the sample at some indeterminate point in time, but cannot distinguish if the genetic maternal originates from active or inert virus. The samples that tested positive on PCR were inoculated into chicken eggs, which were then monitored for growth of the virus.

"From Wild Birds Unlimited's site, as linked, for the lazy:

&gt;Avian Flu has been found in a few limited cases in Corvids (Blue Jays, Magpies, Crows, and Ravens) the Corvids who have contracted Avian Flu all appear to have contracted the flu from eating other sick birds, there is no indication that those Corvids contracted it at feeders. In addition, the USDA has reported a total of 4 confirmed cases of Avian Flu in non-Corvid songbirds across the US in all of 2022, this too indicates that songbirds are not susceptible to Avian Flu and the disease is not at risk of being spread at birdfeeders.

 &gt;There is no need to stop watching, feeding, or attracting feeder birds to your yard because of avian flu. We do not recommend feeding or attracting waterfowl.

&gt;There is no evidence humans are at risk of contracting avian flu from backyard birds or bird feeding.

&gt;The backyard birds that visit our feeders appear to be significantly less susceptible and much less likely to become a source for the virus.

&gt;As with any bird or animal, wild or domestic, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions after direct or indirect contact. Be careful around animal droppings or water used by birds and animals; wash your hands after contact with soap and water.

&gt;It’s always a good idea to practice responsible bird feeding on a regular basis. Clean and sanitize all bird feeders, bird baths, and hardware. If you see or suspect a sick bird we recommend a 10% bleach solution (one-part bleach to nine parts water).

"&gt;Woodpeckers, flickers, and nuthatches are all groups notably present in avian flu death counts. 

Are you sure that nuthatches are being killed in large numbers by avian flu? That surprises me a little because nuthatches are classified as passerines or ""perching birds"", and the sites I consider most trustworthy say that passerines have not been seriously affected by the flu. (Passerines are often called songbirds, but ""perching bird"" is the more accurate definition, denoting how their [toes are arranged to grip branches](https://etc.usf.edu/clipart/72600/72658/72658_birdfeet_lg.gif).)

Woodpeckers are not passerines. Most larger birds are not passerines, including ""poultry"" (chicken, turkey), waterfowl (ducks, goose, pelican), shorebirds (heron, killdeer), raptors (eagle, hawk, owl), and scavengers (buzzard, condor). Many types of non-passerine birds have suffered losses from the avian flu.

"Passerine susceptibility is noted in specific environments where interactions with highly susceptible species are entwined (buntings, thrushes in particular). PCR positive necropsy cases with healthy body mass in surveys do find representation from flickers and nuthatches. But more concerning is the degradation of the environment, and nuthatches are susceptible and an indicator. Species and numbers for song and other birds are down by 30% over the past 50 years. Other species displaced from other areas are moving in to displace local species and the trend will continue as greater political pressure by people for higher density (ironically because they believe it is more environmentally friendly)  to raise local pollution levels and land uses that devastate insect populations (down a measured 60% or more in the past nearly 40 years in Colorado).

Eventually, you'll be able to drive for an hour without so much as a bug on the windshield, and as a result, the area will be devoid of most birds.

"Raw beef meat is certainly in the running as a potential zoonotic vector for H5N1 infection as well. 

I purchased these in late February (two boxes of 40 tests): 
https://www.vetassay-elab.com/p-avian_influenza_virus_h7_antigen_lateral_flow_assay_kit-178.html

I used them outside of the actual package directions, so it isn't a valid survey. I still think it is interesting. I swabbed raw meat samples from 7 stores in Boulder and Longmont, including two ethnic meat suppliers in Longmont. Selections from each store included vertebral cuts (T-bone, etc). The ""ethnic"" cuts additionally included lengua (tongue of course), and machitos (intestine). 

There were 17 samples in all. Control tests for each sample were done using swabs from regular Spam swabs(now is when you can laugh). 

Results:
Controls: zero positives.
samples: 3 positives for H5N1, 14 negatives
Zero inconclusive/failed tests.

The three positive samples were retained and re-tested, along with a random selection of three negative samples. All  three negative samples were negative again, and all three positive samples were positive again. 

The positive samples were each cooked in a pan at 460-485F on one side so than a thermometer read two different temperatures: For each of the two positive vertebral samples, placed adjacent to the bone to read to medium rare (130F-135F) and medium well (150F-155F), respectively, and for the machitos sample, at the center of a ball of the sample to read at 155F.  The samples were removed form the pan onto individual chilled glass Pyrex casseroles to rest for 5 minutes, and then swabs identical or comparable to tests numbers 1 &amp; 2 for each sample were taken, along with three Spam controls (at room temp) for each. The vertebral sample cooked to 152F tested positive. The other two tests were negative. The controls were all negative. 

No positive controls were available. No supplier would sell me H5N1 protein or RNA fragments to test with. And again, this test protocol was done outside of the printed label, and so the specificity and sensitivity is very much in question, or even the validity of the entire test. However, I am told that all samples were delicious after final preparation to a well done state (or broiled, in the case of the machitos). 

This proves nothing, of course. The tests, when used properly (which these were not), are very likely to react with and report on H5N1 specific antigens. It just suggests that beef should be investigated as an obvious potential vector for exposure to viable H5N1 virus. The FDA is doing exactly that as I write this now, and not because I've been asking just about every email address I can find in zoonotic virology research to consider the possibility after completing this test. It was an obvious direction for any researcher to go. 

https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/29/health/usda-beef-bird-flu/index.html

Ground beef (used in the government testing) generally contains a much higher level of nervous tissue that might be  associated with certain viral pathogens. I'm glad they are doing this for H5N1. It is unlikely they will report on any of the other viral antigen loads in the samples since RT-PCR is exceptionally target sensitive. 

As for H5N1 in milk, zero viral plaque forming units (PFU's) have, to date, been found from raw or pasteurized milk samples (in other words, the RNA was there but no detectable potentially viable viral particles). There are few cases where the association with raw milk consumption is strongly suspected in humans, but there are some. In previous studies, PCR fragments from a large variety of viruses has always been present, and are now joined by H5N1, again with zero PFU results in pasteurized samples, and very few in raw samples. 

It is still very easy to pasteurize milk if you are a small producer. It takes us about five minutes to get it going before starting dinner, five minutes to end in  a pail of water to chill after reaching 161F after getting ready to eat dinner, and almost nothing to clean up. That's enough for a few days to a week. 
Our milk is still warm from the udders before pasteurization in general, and it goes into the fridge immediately after processing. If equipment is spotlessly clean (and it should be), and animals are healthy, there is no way even for pathogenic bacteria to become a problem. But in the real world, things happen, and people get seriously sick occasionally and unnecessarily.

The threat of pandemics does change the stakes, and as dairy can be a vector for H5N1, I think it would be prudent to stay away from raw milk until we have a better sense for the risks associated with that virus. As with most contagions, risk multiplies in factory farms (with tens of thousands of animals in close proximity, and weakened immune systems from poor living conditions). Small operations tend to be more resilient in those regards, but I would still want my milk tested on a regular basis.

"You may be drawing a conclusion that isn’t exactly there. I am not sure if you are insinuating that farm bird are dying from the bird flu in such numbers because they are weak farm birds. 

I mean healthy chickens give good eggs, and I’m all for that.

That said, the current bird flu appears to be moving through wild birds pretty quickly, which are pretty organic all things considered. 


Various state agencies are requiring mass slaughter of large amounts of chickens (millions) to try and slow or stop the outbreak from reaching wild birds so that it stops spreading. I mean it already has but that is a side point. 

Anyways “we” keep slaughtering millions of chickens that aren’t necessarily infected or otherwise affected. If testing shows an infection in a area generally all are killed quickly. “We” are slaughtering millions of chickens to attempt to stem the spread to wild birds and other industrial farming places. Often under orders by the state. 

Now you might make the argument that bird flu is more likely to start and gain significant foot hold due to factory farming. However it appears that once it gets out to wild birds, it’s still going to kill large amounts of them. So I’ll ask, which  robustness are you talking about?

"You seem to be putting words in my mouth. 

I have no problem with the industry not knowing about prions in advance. That's understandable: feeding cows mammalian proteins didn't have a harm that we knew of in advance, I had no objection to them doing that. Once it became clear though that mad cow was a possibility, the industry had a right to argue ""nah, lets ignore it, I'm sure its fine, cheaper hamburgers!"" but obviously the rest of society should have and did say ""absolutely not, you need to take steps to prevent mad cow tainting the food supply even if it costs more.""

Using bedding from chickens (I gather that's what's going on here) we evidently know to be a liability for spreading bird flu and it needs to stop. I don't blame the industry for using it initially if they didn't know it could cause human deaths to make slightly more profit, that's to be expected from any industry, but now we need to force them to stop doing it and we're fools if we don't pass laws stopping it.

I also have no complaint about inefficiencies leading to higher costs. I know I'm in the minority here but I do NOT think that it should be ""as cheap as possible"" if that ignores externalized costs like breaking antibiotics, spreading disease, and making the climate permanently unstable.

Saving five dollars off hamburgers at those ignored costs is not worth it to me. I'd much rather the meat industry do it safely (for the rest of the world) or not at all.

Again, that's on us, not the industry, to regulate it. We as a society are idiots if we don't pass laws banning antibiotics, the use of any and all technology to limit GHG (from livestock industries and all other industries) and implement a carbon tax as appropriate to be able to counter the effects of GHG externalized costs.

The meat and dairy industries won't do it on their own, except token gestures to get us to forget about it and think the problem is solved so they can keep maximizing profit.

"I like horses and all, but feral horses are literally an invasive and destructive species in North America. Every year, their population increases by 25%, or 
doubles every four years. I say we need to actually properly cull these horses, not keep them in pens where they give each other a deadly virus. 

I mean, in the last decade alone, we’ve seen the swine flu, avian flu, and the coronavirus (which originally came from bats, then in the middle of 2020 there was a mink scare in Europe). If we just let a virus mutate among thousands of feral horses in BLM pens, there’s a real possibility we’ll have the “equine flu” pandemic too. 

It’s irresponsible to just let these horses stay where they are. They need to be adopted out, and the rest need to be euthanized. Maybe we should allow hunters to take out feral horses in the same way they’re allowed to take out Eurasian Collard Doves and European Starlings.

"From the article:

&gt;In Colorado, there has been one case of an individual contracting avian flu from an infected bird. The case occurred in Delta County this April, when an individual came in direct contact with diseased poultry by doing culling at a commercial farm. The individual did not experience any severe symptoms, and there was no other transmission following this.

I would also note that a Google News search shows other articles about this subject and it looks like the issue is with birds. It's a disaster for agriculture due to how contagious and potentially fatal this is for birds.

However, it  does not appear to be a major issue with humans at this time--certainly not the next COVID-19, if that's what anyone has in mind.",2022-10-09 09:35:55,Colorado,Sadness,0.985024094581604,Topic 4,0.16239245061540772

&gt;Raccoon kills eaglet in Front Range bald eagle nest that’s livestreamed via webcam
Eaglet that perished at Xcel Fort St. Vrain nest was six weeks old. A sibling eaglet survived, as did the parents.

&gt;A six-week-old eaglet was attacked by a raccoon and killed at Xcel Energy’s Fort St. Vrain facility near Platteville on Monday, Colorado Parks and Wildlife has confirmed.
The bald eagle family has a large following because two “eagle cams” are focused on the nest around the clock. Many follow the eagles via the Fort St. Vrain Eagle Cam Facebook group.
A second eaglet survived the attack, as did the mother and father. CPW said wildlife officer Mike Grooms responded to investigate 90 minutes after the attack.
“The camera showed a raccoon scaling to the top of the nest tree and grabbing the older, larger of the two eaglets from the nest around 7 p.m.,” the CPW statement said. “Wildlife officer Grooms was able to collect what remained from the carcass and delivered it to CPW’s Wildlife Health Lab, where officials will submit it for testing of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.”
CPW noted that the nest dates back to 1993 and the camera went online in 2003.
“What followers saw on Monday was a natural event,” the statement said. “Predation of eaglets is not something you often hear about. Without a webcam, such events are hard to document. The vast majority of nest failures in Colorado are attributed to weather events (such as windstorms that damage or destroy nests or nest trees), new nests/inexperienced pairs, the loss of an adult during the nesting season and potentially human-related disturbance in the immediate area.
“The most likely mammalian predator of bald eagles in Colorado’s Front Range are raccoons, while avian predators include magpies, crows and ravens, hawks and owls.”
Many fans of the Fort St. Vrain eagles have commented on the Facebook group page, expressing their sadness over the incident. The group has more than 4,000 members.",2022-06-01 15:49:54,Colorado,Sadness,0.9968632459640504,Topic 20,0.17783032660314163

"As to your question about food prices. Food inflation costs hit a peak a year ago (nationally - like record high for food in recent history), general inflation was caused by a number of factors (Republican tax bill from 4-5 years ago making its impact is one overall), but food inflation has been driven by global prices: Ukraine war (Ukraine is a breadbasket, and provided food across Europe and N Africa), avian flu (chicken and egg prices specifically, but food conglomerates are spreading that around to recoup losses - and eggs are used in a lot of products), and extreme weather events (climate change related) damaging a variety of crop harvests.

National average grocery price inflation rate peaked a year ago and has only now come back down to \~5%. I don't know if it'll go negative to correct (energy prices have done this already, so there's hope - but those are very different sectors), but the inflationary indicators are looking better.
