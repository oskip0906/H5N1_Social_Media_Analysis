Bird flu is ravaging the industry.",2022-02-19 21:48:11,Columbus,fear
"Hot chicken has been not fairing well compared to other Columbus restaurants I’ve been to since the onset of the pandemic, other than the ones that have closed down, obviously. 

I know the bird flu has been a serious problem for them, though the couple times I went, the chicken was one of the only things that have stayed consistent in quality. Both times all their sides were noticeably worse. I don’t think their Mac is homemade anymore (or at least its more apparent it’s made elsewhere) and the beans were really stale too. Have they been this way before the pandemic and I just now notice? Or is this a recent development? I don’t think they’re changing the tea as often or putting lids on the top of their canisters, one time my friend found a fruit fly in his tea. Overall it seems things have gotten more lax there.

I don’t know if they were just having an off-day both times, or if only the Easton Location is bad, but I just figured the supply chain problems have been making them cut a lot of corners. Even compared to other restaurants around though, hot chicken seems to have been struggling pretty bad. It’s a shame, really…",2022-02-25 20:33:26,Columbus,sadness

"The price of chicken quadrupled for wholesale compared to 2020… not only that labor costs have skyrocketed as well. Ultimately it’s up to you to decide if it’s still worth the price. Tbh you should expect more price increases…the bird flu hasn’t even affected the industry atm, and we aren’t even sure if it’s fully contained yet.

"This is nonsensical. 

So let me get this straight – you want the government to take more of people's money as a threat for them to not sell their business? 

And your reason being is because you think that you know X market better than somebody else? 

&gt;Instead of taking a big payout, it's better to keep the company healthy and paying you for decades to come.

There's no guarantee that it'll pay for decades to come. Maybe the market gets saturated with fried chicken joints. Maybe fried chicken stops being trendy/desirable. Maybe there's a ""health"" push and people stop buying your product. Maybe a strain of bird flu wipes out every chicken farm in the country and suddenly you don't have a product.  

Why on earth are you against people cashing out when the moment is right? Just because a brand is worth a bunch of money now does not mean that it will be worth a bunch of money in two years.",2023-04-24 09:31:42,Columbus,other

"I admit I do not fully understand the basis of these inflation charges being added. Fundamentally if the cost of doing business goes up don’t you just charge more for the goods and services you are providing? So could it be laziness like some are implying? And if and when inflation gets better, will they simply drop the fee or if we don’t pay attention will they drop the fee and then raise prices a little? I would think some businesses will start relying on these new charges even if they are small percentages and will include that in planning on the income they expect and will never want to give up this extra revenue. And has this ever happened in the past? I know it’s been a long time since we have seen inflation this bad but I just wonder if businesses did this before. And where does it stop? If the nation gets hit with a big bird flu epidemic and we have to put down our chicken population will the chicken wing joints add a bird flu charge? A drought charge because a drought effected produce prices? You could dream up any charge you wanted to.",2023-05-15 17:33:47,Columbus,other

Along with destruction of hundreds of millions of eggs per year since.  Again, without testing to confirm infection.

"Chicken (and egg) prices are up like 40%, partially due to general inflation, but also because of avian flu outbreak, which has been particularly bad this year. The guidelines for farmers for when a single bird contracts avian flu is to cull the entire flock. Now the supply of chicken is constrained and the price shoots up.

However, I will say that if Chipotle/other restaurants raise their prices to account for the higher chicken prices AND raises the price of their other protein options by the same amount as chicken; that is price gouging and using consumer psychology to maintain that beef/pork are luxury proteins and chicken isn't. Based on my last trip to Kroger, chicken is basically the same price as beef (ground and cheaper cuts excluding nice steak cuts), so why is there a 20% disparity between chicken and beef on most menus?",2022-12-19 10:15:09,Columbus,other

That said (and with a sarcastic streak to boot), I have witnessed first hand (but not by my hands) how regularly feeding geese completely upsets the migratory habits of Canadia Geese.

"&gt;Eggs? One of the food items that have increased in price the most in the past year?  
&gt;  
&gt;Processed food does tend to be cheaper, even if they need to use Whole Foods as their main ingredients. Process foods are able to use Whole Foods that tend to be cheaper. Ever heard of corn syrup? Why do you think corn is a main ingredient in the vast majority of processed foods.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, I find it incredibly ironic that you criticized my point of view for being to simplified, yet the second I bring up economic concepts that are just outside of Econ 101 you disengage and call it a “word salad”. Pick a side man

ok, ok.  so i just smoked a bowl which tends to increase my tolerance for all kinds of pain, including the psychic pain incurred by reading this and the sadness i feel for you to believe all that makes sense.

eggs went up because of shortages due to bird flu, not demand due to poor people getting snap benefits. they're still a great source of protein and dirt cheap compared to say steaks, so your point is meaningless and one i figured you'd latch on to because it's *so fucking simple* and requires no thought past surface ones.

aside from the capitals on 'whole foods' which i'll assume your phone did for you, you're fucking nuts!  why do you think corn syrup is cheap again?  did it occur to you that the starting material must be even *cheaper*?  so much so you can process the shit out of it and still make money.

how about we just mill it into taco shells and give them away.  giving them away will cost more than the fucking taco shells.  labor is much more of a cost in any foodstuff than the actual food, that cost is included in your retail cost.

yes, *your* grasp of economics is certainly just a shade past econ 101, and it shows.

lets start with the bias you show when you categorize food assistance as ""free money"", shall we?  what IS free money to you?

does someone who inherited a house they never lifted a finger to earn receive 'free money'?  how about if they sell the house, buy bonds with that money and get interest every year without lifting another finger?  is THAT free money? 

or, even if they earned it working, and live off the interest, is that free money?

 how about banks that use your deposits to buy bonds and capture that interest?  that free money?  or if they lend against said bonds to capture MORE interest from someone buying a house?  they didn't create that money, or produce goods, not at all, nowhere along the chain, so, is that free money?

i think farmers are just fine with food subsidies, or they should be.  they're still getting paid no matter who consumes it and it benefits all of society when everyone is fed.

"Here's my thoughts to politely disagree with you and why

Put all the covid stuff aside for a minute - think for a moment about the very high chance we have of another pandemic with a completely different disease.  Right now bird flu has been infecting birds and mammals globally and spreading rapidly. very rarely it has infected humans and has not yet transferred human to human. But when it has infected humans, it's roughly a 50% survival rate. About half the people infected so far have died.  It is a matter of time before this virus mutates so that it can be transferred more easily to humans and between humans.  Seriously - this is not an if but when. 

And when that happens think about all the people who refused to wear masks in public during covid who got violent and acted out and thought covid was fake - now we have those same people who are going to hop on the conspiracy train again ever more than last time because there's ANOTHER pandemic.  Except now instead of a 1% death rate like with covid it's almost 50%.  

 There will still be people who have to go out in public to keep society running. Can you imagine if that was you, or someone you love knowing that if they got infected it would be a coin flip if you or they survived?  

I would want our government to use every tool we had to help protect everyone I cared about, so that the people who had no choice but to use public transport and public spaces would be a little more protected and maybe not have to get sick and suffer and die because some selfish assholes who were lucky enough to not get killed by the disease value their personal liberty so much they will kill half the other people they spread the disease to.  

I don't think we will have mask mandates again for covid. I think politicians talking about them now is because we have another variant and it becomes a talking point and a way to rally their base and garner support and make people mad about a problem that doesn't exist anymore. 

 But to make this impossible to do in the future when we could have a much more deadly disease where we want every tool available to curb the spread and keep our society and economy functioning is short sighted.",2023-09-06 14:22:46,Ohio,other

Still, OP is way off base thinking that small, local egg producers selling their eggs at a farmers’ market are going to be anywhere near as low as the prices of industrially produced eggs in a grocery store. Even if they’re sold at cost, that cost also has to take into account transporting the eggs to the market and standing there all day to sell them. I don’t know about OP’s time, but my time is worth more than $10/hr. The economies of scale and having shelf space in a self-service venue like a grocery store are what make eggs affordable, so OP should just stick with store-bought eggs if they don’t want to pay the premium for direct-to-consumer eggs produced by local farmers.",2023-04-01 10:33:53,cincinnati,anger

"No offense to OP, but this post is a prime example of conspiracy thinking. I’m not calling you a conspiracy theorist, I don’t know you and I don’t know how serious you are about this idea. But I like breaking down this kind of thing…

“I found a dead bird in my yard. There are no apparent injuries, so the explanation isn’t obvious.”

There’s nothing wrong with this as an observation by itself, but the next step before adopting any explanation would be to come up with a testable hypothesis. “I don’t see another explanation” is not the same thing as “there is no other explanation.” It’s called an argument from ignorance fallacy: I don’t know any other explanation, so I’ve adopted this one. 

“There are harmful chemicals in the air due to the East Palestine incident. Last night it rained and now there’s a dead bird. Could it be related?”

Again, as a question, there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with asking this. But a suggested explanation shouldn’t be adopted without clear evidence. “It’s possible” is not the same thing as “it’s actual.” Plus, one would need to demonstrate that a specific explanation is even possible before offering it. Has it been demonstrated to be possible for chemicals to travel from East Palestine to Dayton through clouds and rain? If it’s not shown to be possible, it’s not a candidate explanation. 

And correlation is not causation. “My rooster crowed this morning and the sun came up. My rooster must have caused the sunrise!” Two things happening near each other doesn’t mean there’s a causal link. 

Further, we have a single dead bird being floated as a possible pattern. We haven’t established a pattern yet, but let’s say we did. Let’s say more dead birds are found… maybe 5, maybe 10, maybe 1000. Maybe every single bird in Ohio drops out of the sky and dies. We would still need evidence to demonstrate a link between the events in East Palestine and the death of the birds. Simply assuming or asserting a connection is not sufficient, it must be demonstrated. 

Maybe, as another commenter pointed out, it’s avian flu. Maybe there are toxic chemicals in the air from the train derailment AND there’s also something else killing birds. Both could be true. Conspiracy thinking tends to adopt a simple explanation quickly, without considering all options. (Simple meaning satisfying to the person; it doesn’t mean conspiracy theories can’t be complex or complicated. Look at the various features included in OP’s potential explanation)

Conspiracy thinkers also fixate on anomalies. They focus on specific details which stand out or don’t seem to fit, while sometimes ignoring or missing other data. There may be hundreds of living birds flying around OP’s house, but they’ve focused on the dead one. If this is done intentionally (pointing to specific examples that match the theory and ignoring examples that don’t), it’s called cherry-picking.",2023-02-15 11:16:10,Dayton,other
