"If I worked in a job that put me into face to face contact with a lot of people every day I'd make the effort. Right now all my interactions are 100% voluntary. It' just cheaper and easier to wear a mask when I have to go out.

Save the vaccines for those that truly need them. Some years there are shortages. I haven't heard anything yet how the bird flu culls are affecting the supply of available vaccine.  I won't be surprised to hear there are shortages this year.",2022-09-17 12:13:59,ohio,skeptical
"&gt;Nope I will pass you can stick your coma right up your free loading ass and second of all yes there is that many ppl on welfare absolutely and further more you being a mental midget missed my point and then………………….and then ………… oh ya and get a job

you're an angry little neckbeard, aren't you?

 btw, furthermore is one word, there, oh intellectual one.  might want to check your own IQ before attempts at insults about mental capacity.

 i'm retired after working more years than you've been alive so you can set all that aside and instead of assuming the worst about everyone in the world except yourself (which apparently you need to do to feel better about your sad self,) you can use the internet to learn a little about supply and demand, and things like bird flu.

i can see by your other comments below that you have no idea how business works, what lost leaders are, or even how to weigh a chicken.

it would be a good start if you pulled your head out of your self-adoring ass and have some empathy for other people.",2023-01-11 15:02:10,ohio,frustrated
"&gt;Eggs? One of the food items that have increased in price the most in the past year?  
&gt;  
&gt;Processed food does tend to be cheaper, even if they need to use Whole Foods as their main ingredients. Process foods are able to use Whole Foods that tend to be cheaper. Ever heard of corn syrup? Why do you think corn is a main ingredient in the vast majority of processed foods.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, I find it incredibly ironic that you criticized my point of view for being to simplified, yet the second I bring up economic concepts that are just outside of Econ 101 you disengage and call it a “word salad”. Pick a side man

ok, ok.  so i just smoked a bowl which tends to increase my tolerance for all kinds of pain, including the psychic pain incurred by reading this and the sadness i feel for you to believe all that makes sense.

eggs went up because of shortages due to bird flu, not demand due to poor people getting snap benefits. they're still a great source of protein and dirt cheap compared to say steaks, so your point is meaningless and one i figured you'd latch on to because it's *so fucking simple* and requires no thought past surface ones.

aside from the capitals on 'whole foods' which i'll assume your phone did for you, you're fucking nuts!  why do you think corn syrup is cheap again?  did it occur to you that the starting material must be even *cheaper*?  so much so you can process the shit out of it and still make money.

how about we just mill it into taco shells and give them away.  giving them away will cost more than the fucking taco shells.  labor is much more of a cost in any foodstuff than the actual food, that cost is included in your retail cost.

yes, *your* grasp of economics is certainly just a shade past econ 101, and it shows.

lets start with the bias you show when you categorize food assistance as ""free money"", shall we?  what IS free money to you?

does someone who inherited a house they never lifted a finger to earn receive 'free money'?  how about if they sell the house, buy bonds with that money and get interest every year without lifting another finger?  is THAT free money? 

or, even if they earned it working, and live off the interest, is that free money?

 how about banks that use your deposits to buy bonds and capture that interest?  that free money?  or if they lend against said bonds to capture MORE interest from someone buying a house?  they didn't create that money, or produce goods, not at all, nowhere along the chain, so, is that free money?

i think farmers are just fine with food subsidies, or they should be.  they're still getting paid no matter who consumes it and it benefits all of society when everyone is fed.

creating false dichotomies with 'poisons' isn't thinking through the problem, it's avoiding thinking.",2023-01-11 16:44:39,ohio,afraid
"Russia invading Ukraine is also a factor. Ukraine used to export huge amounts of grain around the world. Drought was very bad in Asia, Europe and North America this year.  Grain harvests weren't good. Then there is the world wide epidemic of bird flu affecting egg/poultry prices.

"over aggressive control freak cops did cop things that had nothing to do with any of the information involved. they got mad at him because they thought he was too loud, ffs. read up on it.

animals exposed to the smoke and any vapors i'm sure are impacted, that's not a surprise to anyone, why would it be a surprise to you?  they ordered evacuation immediately after the crash and expanded it for the burn-off.  anyone with a brain took heed and moved their animals as well.  i think it would be a stretch to think they weren't offered any assistance to do so.  where were all these great country neighbors i hear about all the time?

the most i've seen reported is a fox (which is an exotic pet and shouldn't be one imo) and some chickens.  damn near anything kills chickens, so that's not a surprise. it could have been bird flu even.

who was losing money? either the RR's are so filthy rich, or they're not. make up your minds

there ARE legitimate concerns about water and continued volatile compounds at the site, but frankly, you stand next to a diesel truck for a few minutes and you're getting just as much crap in you.

"Im sorry for my hostility, tbh im in a shitty mood and seeing this shit in ohio is just depressing. I just dont want people to disregard the deaths of animals such as chickens to bird flu, yes it very well could be. But look at the reports of people in the area - chickens literally dead overnight, foxes falling ill, countless fish floating down the river dead, and civillians reporting a chemical taste in the air. The plume looks post apocalyptic and it irritates when people say its just bird flu. Just lets the corporations responsible for this hide away while people debate why animals are dying whether things are safe etc. They want people to argue and there to be confusion because then they can hide behind it.",2023-02-13 15:21:49,ohio,frustrated
That could be either from the derailment or bird flu... Should probably have them tested.,2023-02-14 06:27:35,ohio,concerned
"Here's my thoughts to politely disagree with you and why

Put all the covid stuff aside for a minute - think for a moment about the very high chance we have of another pandemic with a completely different disease.  Right now bird flu has been infecting birds and mammals globally and spreading rapidly. very rarely it has infected humans and has not yet transferred human to human. But when it has infected humans, it's roughly a 50% survival rate. About half the people infected so far have died.  It is a matter of time before this virus mutates so that it can be transferred more easily to humans and between humans.  Seriously - this is not an if but when. 

And when that happens think about all the people who refused to wear masks in public during covid who got violent and acted out and thought covid was fake - now we have those same people who are going to hop on the conspiracy train again ever more than last time because there's ANOTHER pandemic.  Except now instead of a 1% death rate like with covid it's almost 50%.  

 There will still be people who have to go out in public to keep society running. Can you imagine if that was you, or someone you love knowing that if they got infected it would be a coin flip if you or they survived?  

I would want our government to use every tool we had to help protect everyone I cared about, so that the people who had no choice but to use public transport and public spaces would be a little more protected and maybe not have to get sick and suffer and die because some selfish assholes who were lucky enough to not get killed by the disease value their personal liberty so much they will kill half the other people they spread the disease to.  

I don't think we will have mask mandates again for covid. I think politicians talking about them now is because we have another variant and it becomes a talking point and a way to rally their base and garner support and make people mad about a problem that doesn't exist anymore. 

 But to make this impossible to do in the future when we could have a much more deadly disease where we want every tool available to curb the spread and keep our society and economy functioning is short sighted.",2023-09-06 14:22:46,ohio,critical

"So a continuous up tick in likes for this posting and the continuing down voting of counter points. Yes I would say that gives me the evidence to make my claim.

Same thing for the cost of groceries. For example the recent price hike in eggs. That had to with a bird flu that wiped out millions of chickens in America. Chickens make eggs.

"Avian flu required millions of domestic birds to be culled this year/last year, so I suspect that would hinder a lot of exhibition for poultry. Unfortunately in the pandemic, many older farmers have also passed away, and farming is already a declining profession with a high average age.

"It'll be super cool if companies stopped building these sites over our wetlands. We only have 1.8% of them left. Idc what you build, just bulldoze somewhere else. Man-made wetlands are not equal to the ones that are removed. 

Oh, and guess which governor removed wetland and ephemeral stream protections under the last administration that denied adding wetlands to the Clean Water Act? 

Hint, the same one who's responsible for the largest bribery scheme in Ohio's political history where First Energy owes the state over $300mil, rolled back food safety during an avian flu outbreak, literally forced state parks to allow fracking, tried to remove birth control, says we can't teach sustainability in college, teacher's can't protest, won't allow state employees to work from home, OH YEAH and got paid THOUSANDS not to strengthen restrictions on railroad safety right before the train derailment AFTER THE LARGEST BRIBERY SCHEME TO BE BROUGHT INTO COURT.
