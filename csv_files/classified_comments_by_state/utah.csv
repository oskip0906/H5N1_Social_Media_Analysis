"Eggs are pricey because bird flu took out a bunch of chickens and it takes time for new chicks to reach egg-laying size. As of last month, 384 flocks in 36 states have been struck in 2022 by the bird flu.",2022-08-23 12:53:58,utah,concerned
"Lol. Of course there are higher costs for a number of reasons, everyone's talking about it and feeling the pinch. I just thought it was funny you brought up *eggs*. Which are a whole issue unto themselves. 

I actually agree with many of the points in that article and I'm surprised at how well it's cited. It is a March 2022 article, so it's missing some of the latest data but the predictions are pretty accurate when you take less-predictable factors like Avian flu (note, it does reference the raised egg and meat prices in 2015 due to bird flu so that's still following a set trend) .

And I quite agree with your article that we need to do something about climate change NOW, as that's a huge factor in food price issues. Convince Mike about that. He wants us to have a bunch of kids and kick the can down the road.",2022-08-23 14:57:53,utah,skeptical
"I linked the wrong quote but you’re still talking about a handful of wild birds that died from bird flu. That’s quite the reach to claim the 15,000 other dead birds died from avian flu when there’s so many articles saying this happens every year.",2023-06-13 16:16:03,utah,skeptical
"My yards been a bird sanctuary all year. Loads of birds visit all hours. I’ve a wide variety of fruits n vegetables, trees, playhouses, and equipment for them. The only bird oddity I’ve seen was the bird flu through Utah last year. I lost half my chickens and found a handful of birds dead about the yard.",2023-09-10 10:09:02,utah,supportive

1. Great big checks from the government had a lot to do with this, but no one ever accuses the government if screwing them with their handouts.
2. When you have millions of chickens culled because of avian flu, the price of eggs goes up.  When you have diesel and gas at record levels, the price of transportation and agriculture goes up.
3. Thank your government.  This was a real r/LeopardsAteMyFace for all the people that voted for green policies and then were shocked when green policies resulted in higher costs.
4. I think these were already covered. (Blame this government and the last)

"I took this photo while showing some European friends around Zion in 2010.

I recently met a condor biologist studying the birds near Cedar Breaks and we discussed condor recovery, their role in the ecosystem, and mortality rates.

Lead poisoning is the number one cause of Condor (and birds of prey overall) mortality.

Condors are carrion feeders, they scavenge gut piles left behind by hunters, which leads to lead poisoning very quickly, one tainted gut pile can spell death for these birds. This year, Condors are being killed by rampant avian flu in Arizona and Southern Utah, adding more stress to their already tenuous population recovery.

I am an avid hunter and have since switched to copper ammunition while hunting. If you hunt with a rifle in Utah please consider the switch, it's more expensive, but it's really wild how many birds we're unintentionally harming with lead.",2023-04-21 16:52:38,utah,concerned

"Avian flu.  The salt water keeps them from decomposing.

The comment about avian flu is incorrect. These died naturally and are a small number compared to the millions that migrate here every winter. Report dead water fowl to DNR and they will come test them to be sure. You can google “dead fowl on the GSL” and get 100 articles over the years about it.,2023-06-13 14:50:42,utah,skeptical

"“The salty waters keep them from decomposing. Luft said that’s typical. What sets this year apart “is actually the first time that I’ve seen Eared Grebes die from avian influenza. We typically got them succumbing to avian cholera.”

Also, [another](https://wildlife.utah.gov/news/utah-wildlife-news/1579-dwr-confirms-avian-flu-in-wild-birds-in-4-additional-counties.html) article that mentions the avian flu.  But not specifically GSL.
