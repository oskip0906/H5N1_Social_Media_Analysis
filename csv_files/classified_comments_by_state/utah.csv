"The price of something is determined by supply vs demand. If there is a low supply and a high demand for a specific commodity (i.e. housing), the price will be high. In order to bring the price down, there either needs to be an increase in supply or a decrease in demand.

Building more houses increases the overall supply, thus lowering the price.

Another example is eggs. The price of eggs has increased dramatically recently because of an egg shortage due to a bird flu (avian influenza) outbreak that occurred over a year ago. The outbreak caused a drop in the number of chickens which then lead to a decrease in egg yield later on. The demand for eggs didn't change, but the supply went down. This caused the price of eggs to skyrocket. The only way to decrease the price of eggs (without government intervention) is to increase the supply of eggs. Until the supply of eggs increases enough to match the demand, expect high egg prices.

Similarly, until the supply of housing in SLC increases to match the demand, expect high housing prices.",2023-02-10 13:22:55,saltlakecity,Anger,0.9636542201042176,Topic 9,0.365772296942112

You can pick one, but not both.

As others have said, prices for ... well, everything have gone up in the last few years and chicken is one of those. Wings are no longer the leftover scraps that are sold for a fraction of what the other chicken parts are. I usually just bite the bullet and buy the [Kirkland Party Wings](https://sameday.costco.com/product/6603/kirkland-signature-%2522air-chilled%2522-chicken-party-wings) from Costco, but they're really not *that* much cheaper than boneless breasts and thighs (both $3.50/lb last I went) and season/sauce them myself since eating out has gotten really costly.

There was also a somewhat recent chicken shortage due to mass avian flu.

"Okay two thoughts. 

1) how can these apartments be luxury, but also faux luxury? Luxury is just a branding term. None of the ""luxury"" apartments are anything special. It's all just new housing that they want to pretend is flashy. 

2) that's exactly my point. We've chronically underbuilt housing, (and pretty reliably only allowed single family home) for at least since the financial crisis in 08 and probably before. We're so short on housing that vacancy rates are at an all time low, even at high prices! It seems obvious to me that replacing a few single family homes with 100 apartments is a clear win because we need the housing! Look at places that have wealthy residents and have fought up zoning effectively (aves, east bench, most of the suburbs). You got shitty 100 year old tiny houses selling for over a million because people want to live there!
