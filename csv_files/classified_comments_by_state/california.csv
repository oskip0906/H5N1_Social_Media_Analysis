"You didn‚Äôt wear a mask during swine flu, bird flu, or any other bad flu season and there were immunocompromised people back then too.",2022-02-08 04:41:19,LosAngeles,Anger,0.97993141412735,Topic 6,0.18569533817705186
"Let me preface this by saying I don‚Äôt give a shit whether people wear them or not.

I‚Äôm with you man but calling mask wearing during a pandemic a dystopia really detracts from your original point and makes you look nutty. Especially saying that we weren‚Äôt wearing masks before for ‚Äúthousands of years‚Äù. We also didn‚Äôt use soap, antibiotics, or GPS. GPS can track you. D Y S T O P I A. We also used masks during the Spanish flu outbreak. Asia used masks during the SARS and bird flu outbreaks. 

I agree that people are frustrated bc the state handled this all wrong from the jump. Government inefficiency is the real dystopia. And we can‚Äôt wear masks for ever, that shit is unrealistic. There is definitely a status quo made for wearing masks and I think in some cases there is over policing.

But using that word because it affects you way less as a healthy adult while others don‚Äôt want old and immunocompromised people to die is over the top. My friends and family have waited weeks and months for bodies that couldn‚Äôt be processed in a timely manner because of how many dead there were in the moratoriums and cemeteries. Shit was real. Not a dystopia. A reality.

That being said, it‚Äôs time. People have picked their side: vaxx‚Äôd or not. I think it‚Äôs fine to not require masks in places that aren‚Äôt medical centers or have concentrations of people with weakened immune systems. I think it‚Äôs fine to allow people to not wear them as long as they aren‚Äôt sick. Maybe the vax turns us all into 5G zombies, maybe the unvaccinated fuck around and find out. It is what it is now.

100% of the people I see calling this a dystopia literally just don‚Äôt want to wear a piece of cloth over their face rather than actually have substantive criticisms of the mandates and lockdowns. Not saying that this is or isnt the category you fall into but throwing around ‚Äúdystopia‚Äù really sends that vibe.

Also saying you‚Äôve been here for 20 years doesn‚Äôt mean anything. I respect the opinion of anyone who has been here to experience the pandemic as worth discussing and if you want to use being ‚Äúgrandfathered‚Äù into an area as your opinion being more valid, most people in the city outrank you.",2022-02-09 18:29:09,LosAngeles,Sadness,0.8221680521965027,Topic 6,0.27556316071746606

The aquarium was enjoyable as well and the Safari Park is amazing. A lot of the bird exhibits are empty because of the bird flu, which is sad but also makes it easier to do the park in one day (depending on how long you like to stay at each exhibit).

"Hey, listen. I don't mean to be alarmist but it's kind of important. Avian flu is circulating in the US right now, including L.A. County, and has been killing wild birds, including hawks. If that hawk was killed because it was weak/sick, or died of avian flu, whatever ate it might also have been infected (it's killed foxes, skunks, raccoons, bobcats, mountain lions, bears, dogs, even housecats - basically anything that will eat a bird or a bird carcass). It CAN be transmitted to humans who handle infected birds, and it's very serious in people.

I assume you've already cleaned it up but you should make sure it's double-bagged. Gloves and mask when handling it, disinfect the area where it was. Don't keep any loose feathers or anything.

Report the dead hawk to the county, because if you still have the carcass they may want to test it. There's more info from the county and where to report it here:

"I have done some research which is why I took issue with this comment. The CPI has been increasing at a rapid pace and it can't all be blamed on just someone who decided to charge more. Did you know we have killed millions of chickens this year due to avian flu which would explain why egss are more expensive. Factory shutdowns over the last few years have also led to a scarcity of goods across the globe, we can ease this by opening factories in America which no one is talking about.

"Everyone has biases it's called opinions, which are the foundation of having arguments. Point me to your sources that talk about worker productivity being quantified into dollars and that shows the money is being stolen by the ""bosses"". Also, you are going way too broad talking about the ""system"" , most people just want to be paid a living wage and I'm just pointing out they are going to be better served by looking at the larger issues with prices increasing now. The price of goods should come down to the wages we are making now and not wages adjusting to the price of goods. I have pointed out the fault a few times now in the knee jerk reaction to blaming price increases on ""the corp"" without understanding what went into it. For example when I brought up the chicken genocides, why do we kill the whole flock when one gets avian flu? Why doesn't the FDA mandate quarantine procedures. I know you will say they don't because the 1% want decreased demand which is true but why are we just rolling over and letting them dictate policy to the FDA?

"It's because restaurant owners are worried that the market isn't ready for the actual cost of food. Years ago David Change wrote an article in GQ about how his $17 bowl of ramen really ought to cost $28, but the market wasn't willing to bear that price difference, and no one would come to eat it if he charged what he really needed to to keep that dish appropriately profitable. That was maybe 10 years ago, and the truth has remained the same. A workaround, which I also agree is disingenuous and a little shady, is to start adding these fees. 3% or 5% here and there isn't so bad. But it's quickly gotten out of control especially since COVID.  
  
COVID did a number on the restaurant industry as well. 4 years ago a case of eggs (180 ea), cost $40 a case. When the avian flu hit the egg producers 2 years ago, that price more than doubled. It was one of the major reasons The Nickel Diner couldn't remain open. Supply chains destroyed any predictability in getting proper goods. The EXTENSIVE limitations to styles of service and limited staff willing to work also destroyed many restaurants. All the smaller businesses lost out on the PPP loans to the larger more legally equipped counterparts.  
  
Yes, there are bigger investor-backed restaurants that can be greedy or whatever, but I guarantee you the people who love this business, like myself, are seeing fewer and fewer opportunities for growth and sustainability. I think we're going to see a reduction in style of service, like counter service style places instead of a server coming to the table, slimmer menus with fewer unique options, and a ""blanding"" effect of the entire industry.  
  
While I agree the fees are silly and are out of control, I'm also concerned guests will get some real sticker shock when a lot of restaurants, mine included, will have to increase their prices by a noticeable amount in July, which will lead to an extreme drop in business. LA is not doing the once thriving and beautifully diverse diaspora of small business owned restaurants any favors.",2024-05-16 21:42:27,LosAngeles,Anger,0.999411940574646,Topic 19,0.10831903834342521

"Industrially produced eggs are *very* dependent on energy, grain, and soy costs. Picture a long metal shed the size of a football field full of birds. Gotta vent out the shit fumes. You need artificial lighting that simulates daylight to keep production consistent through the winter. With the high density of most industrial operations you might even need actual HVAC in an area like Petaluma. 

You also need feed. A lot of it. That's grain and soy, but grain prices are high because of the invasion of Ukraine. Grain prices are also high because corn or wheat are nitrogen intensive crops; natural gas is the main feedstock for nitrogen fertilizer which is also an energy intensive process to create. Then it all needs shipping.


$7/doz is probably high for an industrial operation but their production costs have absolutely gone up.


The avian flu thing is another big part of this. Industrial meat brids are slaughtered at around 42 days. You're 3 weeks away from fertilized eggs hatching and 6 more weeks away from slaughter. Laying birds take months before they start producing. 0-5ish months is basically all cost, then 6ish-24ish months is when your birds are productive for marketable eggs.


If you have to slaughter all the birds at a site when they're 14 months old you're losing your birds at peak production and you're losing them 10 months early. In 3 weeks + ~5 months you had planned on buying replacements but now you need to buy early and if you amortized costs across a bird's life you lost over half of its productive time.

"As a frequent visitor of the Safari Park, I will say that the tours are worth it and depends on what you want to see. The one that‚Äôs always on top of my list to do when possible is the deluxe caravan Safari aka the deluxe wildlife Safari. This takes you into the multi-acre field exhibits, each broken into geographical zones. The deluxe wildlife Safari is 90 minutes along, typically will take you into East Africa and Asian savanna. You‚Äôll see white rhinos, several Antelope species ,giraffes, crowned cranes, wildebeests, and Cape buffalos in East Africa. In the Asian Savanna, you‚Äôll have Indian rhinos, banteng which are wild cattle, a few different deer species, Nilgai, and Blackbuck which are Indian antelope species that I love. 

I truly love that Safari tour the most and I appreciate the multi-species approach as it allows for animals to have interactions with one another in their native range. 

As for other paid Safaris, the BTS tours are a solid choice as well. I‚Äôve done tours for elephants, rhinos, and Walkabout Australia. All were fun and very informative tours. They recently combined the rhinos and elephants tour into 1 so perhaps that would be a fun one to do, I plan to do it as soon as I have extra money üò≠

As for what you can do without paying extra, there‚Äôs quite a bit and you can easily kill a few hours walking around. The exhibits I think are stellar in regards to design and animals features definitely are Lion Camp, Tiger Trail, Walkabout Australia, and Condor Ridge. Lion Camp is almost 20 years old but still regarded as one of the most impeccable lion habitats in the country. Tiger Trail is very immersive, making use of its landscape and foliage to replicate an Southeast Asian jungle for both their tigers and visitors. Walkabout Australia houses the only 2 platypuses outside their native range but can be a bit hard to spot due to the lighting, there is a marsupial walking area where kangaroos and wallabies can literally walk(or hop) in front of you.

"Inflation costs aren't evenly distributed. Some sectors - like clothing - have seen very little inflation. Food is a sector that's seen above-average inflation. Eggs, for example, are up ~300% since January 2022. It's not just perceived cost - these are real costs incurred in the production and distribution chain. Another huge factor is the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) that started last year and has killed over 44 million hens.

HPAI is affecting all poultry prices, which is putting demand pressure on all meat prices. (It's also the reason that every aviary at the zoo has sanitizing pads at the entrance and why the flamingos and penguins are off exhibit).

Airport food costs more because airport rent is 2-3x more than comparable commercial rent, suppliers charge more to deliver to airports, and because employment costs are higher.

"&gt; 
&gt; Six birds in Orange County have tested positive for avian flu, according to the county‚Äôs Health Care Agency.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúAvian flu is present in Orange County and while the risk of transmission to humans is low, residents should stay away from any dead birds,‚Äù Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county‚Äôs public health officer, said in [an advisory](https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/oc-health-care-agency-reports-avian-flu-confirmed-orange-county-birds). ‚ÄúBird flu is very contagious among birds and can sicken and even kill certain domesticated bird species including chickens, ducks and turkeys.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Authorities advise people and their pets to avoid wild birds ‚Äî whether dead or alive ‚Äî and surfaces that may be contaminated with bird saliva or feces. They are advised to contact a healthcare provider if they or their pets become sick after being exposed to ill or dead birds and to report sick or deceased birds to [the California Department of Fish and Wildlife‚Äôs website](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Laboratories/Wildlife-Health/Monitoring/Mortality-Report).
&gt; 
&gt; Signs of the disease among domesticated and wild birds include sudden death; respiratory distress; clear discharge from the eyes, nose or mouth; lethargy; disinterest in food or water; swelling of the eyes, head, wattles or combs; a discolored or bruised comb, wattle or legs; and stumbling or falling.
&gt; 
&gt; The Orange County announcement comes less than a week after Los Angeles County‚Äôs first avian flu cases of the year [were reported](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-18/bird-flu-los-angeles-county-first-case-avian-flu) as birds migrate south for winter amid a global wave of the deadly virus, known as H5N1.
&gt; 
&gt; Public health officials warn that while avian flu is not typically a threat to humans, people should take steps to avoid infection and help stop the spread of the virus.
&gt; 
&gt; The state Department of Fish and Wildlife advised hunters in particular to take action to limit their potential exposure to the virus, which has wreaked havoc among avian populations this year.
&gt; 
&gt; In the U.S., nearly 48 million birds in 43 states have died this year as avian influenza has proliferated across the country, [according to](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-commercial-backyard-flocks) the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Experts have said that number is likely a significant undercount, because many bird flu deaths are not detected or reported.
&gt; 
&gt; Poultry farms have euthanized entire flocks of chickens and turkeys this year in response to the threat, and thousands of wild birds have been killed by the virus across the U.S. As fall migration gets underway, [experts say](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-03/infectious-bird-flu-spreads-california-chickens-wild-birds) an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù wave of death among domestic and wild bird populations is spreading south, including to Southern California.
&gt;

"You really dont understand chemistry and the refining process do you.... Gasoline and Diesel are made from the same general product, Crude Oil. Gasoline and Diesel are made at different temperatures, have different chemical compositions as well as different specific gravities. There are 2 distinct methods to make Gasoline and Diesel, they are just made with the same natural product, Crude Oil.

The reason Diesel prices are higher than gas prices is because (partially) due to demand. Gasoline is used more in the US versus Diesel. Therefore, Oil/Gas companies make less Diesel than Gasoline and therefore prices go slightly higher as there is less supply.

You also dont understand how supply and demand work. There is a limited amount of supply of Natural Gas (not a derivative of Crude Oil, this is something different). The local Gas company has to buy this from Oil/Gas companies who are charging this higher rate. The local gas company is then delivering these increases to us. To be fair, the local Gas Companies were very transparent in the fact that temporary price increases were coming.

The same thing is currently happening with Eggs. Supply is significantly down due to Avian Flu. So prices go up. It sucks but nothing we can do about it....

While there may be some price gouging, specifically by the oil companies, Supply is way down. And that is always going to cause price increases. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do. The government back in the day decided to make utilities privatized and the consumers have been suffering for years because of this. If utilities were still run by the government, we definitely wouldnt be seeing this stuff occuring, but who knows what other problems may have come because of that (i.e. slow response times, corrupton, etc.)

"&gt;Any trip to the grocery store does not fit the narrative that inflation has gone down. You name it; everything has doubled or tripled in cost. Eggs, if you can find them, have tripled in price; chicken and meat, the same. If inflation has come down, no evidence of it has appeared on the West Coast.

Inflation going down doesn't mean prices will go down.  That would require deflation, which can be even worse than inflation.  Inflation going down just means the rate of the price increases is falling, thus prices are still increasing, just at, you know, a slower rate.  Also, it's not like everything in the economy happens at instant speed.  The price adjustments have to work their way through the entire economy.  While prices are stabilizing for some things, other things are still catching up to the current inflated prices.  Finally, local factors can alter the prices of commodities in a particular locale.  For instance, egg prices are high because an outbreak of bird flu is causing us to cull egg-laying hen populations, so our egg prices are going to be higher for until the egg-laying hen population returns to normal levels, increasing egg supplies.

"This isn‚Äôt really directed at you directly, but just a general FYI. There is a huge H5N1 Avian Flu outbreak right now in the US and the types of birds that are most impacted and likely to be contagious with it are water fowls (ducks, geese and other birds that spend time in or on the water). If you see a water fowl or any wild bird that is sick do not touch it or go near it and call Animal Rescue or/and Fish and Wildlife and specifically state it is a water fowl and appears sick.

"**[Human mortality from H5N1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mortality_from_H5N1)** 
 
 &gt;Human mortality from H5N1 or the human fatality ratio from H5N1 or the case-fatality rate of H5N1 refer to the ratio of the number of confirmed human deaths resulting from confirmed cases of transmission and infection of H5N1 to the number of those confirmed cases. For example, if there are 100 confirmed cases of humans infected with H5N1 and 10 die, then there is a 10% human fatality ratio (or mortality rate). H5N1 flu is a concern due to the global spread of H5N1 that constitutes a pandemic threat. The majority of H5N1 flu cases have been reported in southeast and east Asia.
