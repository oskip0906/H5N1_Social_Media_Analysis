"Cal-Maine Foods

FTA:

‚ÄúThe largest egg producer in the United States said Tuesday that it temporarily ceased operations at one of its Texas facilities after detecting bird flu in chickens ‚Äî the latest in a steady uptick of cases among U.S. farm animals in recent weeks.

Cal-Maine Foods said it culled about 1.6 million hens and 337,000 pullets (young hens) after some of its chickens at a Parmer County, Texas, facility tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild and domestic birds.

A dairy worker in Texas was being treated for the virus that causes avian influenza, becoming only the second known human case in the United States, state and federal officials said Monday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the person tested positive for H5N1 bird flu.

The culled chickens at Cal-Maine Foods represent 3.6 percent of its flock as of March 2, it said. The company said ‚Äúno farm is immune from HPAI‚Äù but added that it ‚Äúremains dedicated to robust biosecurity programs across its locations.‚Äù

Minnesota officials reported the first infection of bird flu among livestock in the United States last month, when a juvenile goat living on a farm with infected chickens tested positive.

Last month, bird flu was also detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas. Later that week, U.S. officials said that cows in Michigan had tested positive and that there were presumptive positive tests among cows in Idaho and New Mexico, suggesting that the virus may be spreading among cattle.

On Tuesday, Michigan‚Äôs Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced that bird flu was detected at a commercial poultry plant in Ionia County, ‚Äúthe fourth detection of HPAI in a commercial facility‚Äù since the virus was first spotted in the state in 2022.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture also said Tuesday that cases were detected in a dairy cow herd in Idaho.

Officials have said the risk to human health remains low. But the CDC has warned that people with unprotected exposure to infected birds or other animals, including livestock, are at greater risk of infection.

People should also avoid uncooked or undercooked food, unpasteurized milk and raw cheese, according to the CDC. Cooking eggs or poultry to an internal temperature of about 165 degrees Fahrenheit generally ‚Äúkills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses,‚Äù it says. Backyard chickens or pet chickens are at risk if they come in contact with wild birds carrying the virus.

Human symptoms of bird flu include eye redness, fever, coughing, sore throat, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or seizures are less common, the CDC said.‚Äù",2024-04-03 12:29:20,texas,concerned

"In early February, dairy farmers in the Texas Panhandle began to notice sick cattle. Nearly 60 days passed before veterinarians identified the culprit: a highly pathogenic strain of the bird flu virus, H5N1. Had it been detected sooner, the outbreak might have been swiftly contained. Now it has spread to at least eight other states, and it will be hard to eliminate.¬†

Why did it take so long to recognize the virus on high-tech farms in the world‚Äôs richest country? Because even though H5N1 has circulated for nearly three decades, its arrival in dairy cattle was most unexpected. Tests for contagious diseases known to whip through herds came up negative. Some farmers wondered if the illness was related to ash from wildfires devastating land to the east.

An early indication that something had gone awry on farms in northwestern Texas came from devices hitched to collars on dairy cows. Darren Turley, executive director of the Texas Association of Dairymen, describes them as ‚Äúan advanced fitness tracker.‚Äù They collect a stream of data, such as a cow‚Äôs temperature, its milk quality, and the progress of its digestion ‚Äî or, rather, rumination ‚Äî within its four-chambered stomach. What farmers saw when they downloaded the data in February stopped them in their tracks. One moment a cow seemed perfectly fine, and then four hours later, rumination had halted. ‚ÄúShortly after the stomach stops, you‚Äôd see a huge falloff in milk,‚Äù Turley said. ‚ÄúThat is not normal.‚Äù

In hindsight, Turley wished he had made more of the migrating geese that congregate in the panhandle each winter and spring. Geese and other waterfowl have carried H5N1 around the globe. They withstand enormous loads of the virus without getting sick, passing it on to local species, like blackbirds, cowbirds, and grackles, that mix with migrating flocks. But with so many other issues facing dairy farmers, geese didn‚Äôt register.¬†

Sometime in March, viruses appear to have hitched a ride to other states as cows were moved between farms. The limited genomic data available links the outbreak in Texas directly to others in New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota. However, the routes are imprecise because the USDA hasn‚Äôt attached dates and locations to data it releases.

Researchers don‚Äôt want to be caught off guard again by the shape-shifting H5N1 virus, and that will require keeping tabs on humans. Most, if not all, of about 900 people diagnosed with H5N1 infections worldwide since 2003 acquired it from animals, rather than from humans, Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at the World Health Organization said. About half of those people died.

Occasional tests of sick farmworkers aren‚Äôt sufficient, he said. Ideally, a system is set up to encourage farmworkers, their communities, and health care workers to be tested whenever the virus hits farms nearby.",2024-05-23 16:20:29,texas,concerned

"Because of the near 100 % mortality in wild birds (largely passerines)  and commercial chicken and turkey flocks ,and potential virulency when it jumps to humans (aout 50% mortality) global monitoring of of H5N1  and its ""cousins"" has been a top priority since the late nineties.  H5N1 highly pathogenic avian flu is highly mutable and often described as ""the big one"" by virologists and epidemiologists. Covid is referred to as ""preparedness practice"" for a H5N1 human pandemic.  I feel relieved that many countries are alert, have been historically prepared or beginning to prepare. Many have stockpiled somewhat effective antivirals and prototype vaccines. The vaccine use ""old technology' and would require many months to ramp up production...that is a worry.  I hope we are working on new fast technology vaccines.  

  
What can we do? 

1.Pressure the FDA and related federal agencies  to ramp up monitoring and reporting of H5N1 in wild mammals (48 species to date have been affected), in commercial animal stock including dairy and beef cattle, and pigs and goats. Infections in pigs are especially concerning as we share similar genetic vulnerabilities"" to many pathogens.

3. Begin informing and educating the public, and listening to farmers. I have been impressed with local responses in the chicken and dairy industry. Farmers are very worried . They need the latest information as it emerges. But I worry that politics and money will carry more weight than public health. the FDA and associated federal agencies have their heads in the sand about this.  The public needs to be better informed and risks. 

4. Always be personally prepared for epidemics and pandemics. 

  
Where to go for information?  

1. I go to PubMed , where you can find all scientific papers and government documents from every country. But the papers are difficult going. Still if you want to try - do a search on avian flu in humans and limit it to the year 2023- 2024. I also go to the virology chat rooms. The science is pretty heavy but you can see the science reported without fear of government repercussions .. remember what happened to the chinese scientists and doctors who tried to warn about Covid in late 2019?

2. The WHO is more informative than the CDC.  

3. Media? Its tough to separate the fact from the fake.  As a biologist who teaches students to separate science fact from fake science the media source that is most scientifically/medically correct is the New York Times science section. ..not the editorials.  Many of the other media sources are loaded with disinformation.

4. Science News is an on line journal that takes the latest science and reviews it for the public. Its excellent.

5. I find it most useful to do a google search on : Avian Flu and set the date screen to most recent.

"Eh, not necessarily. The rate you're stating is based on very, very, very iffy methodology because the areas where humans have been infected with H5n1 are areas where ~99% of people who aren't already at death's door aren't going to bother to get treated/tested.

"I believe they worked on a dairy farm(I'm unsure of which one exactly) in the panhandle and contracted the virus there.

There have been several infected humans at this point, all from contact with infected cows and their bodily fluids, etc.

As of this moment, there is no recorded human to human transmission, and the virus would need to undergo the right mutations for that to happen.
But people can get sick from ingesting or improperly handling infected raw milk, raw cheese, or raw beef.

For what it's worth, the H5N1 virus is confirmed in a fairly large number of US dairy farms, not just in Texas. Something like ‚Öì of all commercial milks in grocery stores are testing positive with the virus fragments, but pasteurization neutralizes it.",2024-05-05 20:00:03,texas,concerned
"You can check out the r/H5N1_AvianFlu subreddit which gets a lot of updates shared.

Some commenters are very level headed, some are bordering on prepping for a big outbreak, some are convinced the world will end and everyone will die.

As of right now, I don't think there's any significant risk of infection UNLESS you actively work in a dairy/cow farm, chicken/poultry farm, or interact regularly with animals that have been confirmed to be infected with the virus. Also, if you are actively avoiding handling and consuming raw OR undercooked beef, eggs, chicken, milk, cheese, etc, your risk is extremely low.

From my understanding, the virus has not reached human to human transmission. All confirmed human infections are from people who interacted with sick/infected animals/spaces.

The virus does need to go through certain mutations to be able to become human to human transmissible.

ONE of these mutations has been confirmed, but it needs to go through multiple mutations.

IF the virus is detected in pigs, these mutations become more likely and the risk becomes greater.

Other animals interacting with infected farm animals have fallen ill with quite severe symptoms and have died, including farm cats as well as a domestic NON farm cat, so the virus may be spreading to other cats outside of these farms.

Owners should keep their cats indoors, and also make sure their dogs don't try to lick/eat bird poop or raw/undercooked beef/eggs/dairy(if you feed your pet a raw/freeze dried diet, this is a legitimate concern).

The CDC has highly recommended farm workers wear appropriate PPE, but they essentially said the CDC can f‚Ä¢ck off and that they won't take extra necessary precautions.

But, as of right now, in this moment and stage of the virus, I wouldn't be too concerned if you're being careful about what you and your pets consume. Maybe also avoid spending time with any friends or family that actively work on at risk farms if you want to be extra extra extra cautious. This would be moreso due to if they have virus particles on their person from farm animal feces/fluids that you could pick up, not so much about any human to human transmission risk.

Additionally, the appropriate entities have stated that an adequate vaccine specifically for H5N1 could be created in a matter of weeks with an expedited rollout in the event that it does become human to human.

The greatest risk is in those early weeks/months before people can get vaccinated, so at the earliest confirmation of any human to human spread, just make some life changes and be extra careful(we all know how different people will handle this stage based on the Covid pandemic).",2024-05-12 15:13:32,texas,concerned

"It is raging through farms but we don't know what the human version will look like: infectivity rate and a whole host of other factors. COVID was quite unique in its infectivity rate and the nature of its asymptomatic spread. In retrospect, it was impossible to contain.

Other outbreaks have occurred where the infectivity rate is low and you can only transmit when symptoms are showing. The diseases are still difficult to contain, but we do a much better job. Swine Flu raged a couple years ago.. it was bad, but nowhere near as bad as COVID.

With H5N1, we have some vaccines, therapeutics and tests. As I understand it, the Flu A tests works on H5N1. I am not saying that scientists have a handle on it, but they know a lot about this flu already. As I understand it, there are very few human cases.

It could take days or years for it to transfer to humans in a form that is more transmissible. No one knows.

The real worry is that meat and food prices in general will spike because of this outbreak on farms. In the past two years, the multinationals have been cutting production capabilities. So, the next hiccup in the supply chain means higher prices.",2024-05-12 19:02:05,texas,afraid
"Are vaccinated against COVID-19 ? 

If not, you're fucked. I say you're fucked because any vaccine to H5N1 will be a mRNA vaccine and if you refused the COVID-19 vaccines it's highly probable you'll refuse this new vaccine. 

If you are current on your vaccinations, you'll most likely be fine because you'll follow common sense measures like social distancing, masking up in public and limiting your travel.",2024-05-12 21:40:11,texas,informative
"I would probably be slightly concerned about feeding raw poultry or beef based foods to my pets since cats are confirmed to be vulnerable to the virus.

Commercial companies should be doing their own testing and due diligence to guarantee a safe and healthy product, but there definitely can be instances where something is missed or not properly cleared.

For instance, the local farm I buy my dairy from had an issue just recently when pasteurizing their chocolate milk and extended a recall and urged anyone who purchased the milk to return it for a full refund. Pasteurization neutralizes the virus.

It is a risk that the turkey in your pets food may be sourced from a farm that failed to properly cull/clear the virus from their flock before sending out bad meat and the pet food company may do their own testing but some bad batches may get out and be fed to pets before they catch it and issue a recall.

It's essentially a risk you have to decide if you want to take.

There are pet recalls on kibble based foods and canned foods. Sometimes, things just get through their protocols. I would personally consider raw pet foods to be a higher risk for now, though, just because of how widespread H5N1 seems to be across various farms and testing can't seem to keep up.",2024-05-12 22:40:29,texas,concerned

[Dr. Webby](https://www.stjude.org/directory/w/richard-webby.html) is a Flu researcher/expert at St Judes

Summary: Transmission of the current strain in cows is strange. It is not resperatory but seems to be passed from cow udder to udder in the milking area.  The strain does not have receptor binding domains for human or cow resperatory cells. The only documented cow to human case was conjunctividas because the human eye does have receptors for the strain. Cases in humans and other mammals are most likely under-tested and undercounted. 

The virus strain is deadly in ferrets. Ferrets are normally a good model for people disease, but not in this case.",2024-05-13 07:26:59,texas,concerned

**where have we seen human infections?:  Here's a clip from the very conservative CDC:**

More than 700 human infections with Asian HPAI H5N1 viruses have been reported to WHO from primarily 15 countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe and the Near East since November 2003. Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt have reported the highest number of human HPAI Asian H5N1 cases to date.

Although human infections with this virus are rare, **approximately 60% of the cases have died.**

The majority of human infections with Asian HPAI H5N1 have occurred among children and adults younger than 40 years old. Mortality has been highest in people aged 10-19 years old and in young adults. 

Most human Asian HPAI H5N1 cases have presented for medical care late in their illness and have been hospitalized with severe respiratory disease. However, some clinically mild cases have been reported, especially in children.",2024-05-13 12:25:31,texas,informative
