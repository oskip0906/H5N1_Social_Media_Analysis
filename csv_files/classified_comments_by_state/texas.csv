"&gt;We will learn a lot,

Some of us will learn a lot.   I wonder if the national knowledge level won't end up actually lower.  

God, I'm afraid of what will happen WHEN, not if, a ""real"" deadly disease spreads through the country and all the assholes refuse to take precautions.   

The fatality rate per infection for COVID is pretty low compared to what some other diseases have.  

Imagine what the response will be if we get something infectious like COVID, but deadly like some strains of bird flu that have over a 50% fatality rate.  

MERS had a fatality rate more than 10x that of COVID, and it's a strain of coronavirus closely related to COVID.  

The current crop of assholes is going to refuse to take precautions unless it's like flubola and people are bleeding from the eyes.",2022-02-10 00:58:07,austin,afraid
"Wow.  Lotta words there. 

Yeah, I'm really concerned about what happens when a ""real"" disease hits, not something with a 1-2% fatality rate like COVID.  

Flubola, another 1918 style swine flu.  What's really scary to me is that ""Bird flu"" has 50% or fatality rate, but luckily, doesn't spread easily from human to human.  If ""bird flu"" mixes with regular flu and learns to spread like it does, we could have a real humdinger. 

The Trumpanzees are going to make it really hard to take up effective countermeasures if another bad pandemic starts in the next decade or two.   

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The CDC flat out lied about mask effectiveness because they were more worried about the nationwide mask stock than public trust.

Some of the statements were a little more nuanced than that.  For instance, I think it was Fauci who said something like ""you don't need to be wearing an N95 mask.""   It sounds crazy in hindsight, but there were probably 100 cases a day in the USA when he said that.  You need it a lot more a month later when there are 100 times as many people out there spraying COVID.",2022-02-13 10:50:07,austin,concerned
It took me until Covid to understand seeing Asian people at the airport and on my airplane that they didn’t have some crazy infectious disease like bird flu and that they wear masks for the common cold. I thought before Covid anytime I saw an ethnic person with a mask on they were gravely sick not just doing it for common courtesy. I think that idealization stemmed back as a kid seeing the television with images of Sars and people in masks in China and not understanding it at the time.,2022-02-26 06:59:45,austin,informative
"Yes, apparently Omicron is less serious once caught, but it partly makes it up by being more infectious.  Thank God for the less serious part.

Sort of like the old discount car dealer slogan.  We lose a little on each sale, but make it up in volume.

Long COVID is my big scary unknown right now.   God knows my IQ is already low enough without any help from COVID.   Plus things like long term increased heart problems.

Man, we're going to be in a real world of hurt if another strain comes along that's both virulent and more serious.  Far too many people are simply done with protecting themselves and other from COVID.  Or when bird flu learns to spread from human to human like regular flu.",2022-02-26 13:01:03,austin,afraid
"There's a good chance of that, but I'm still somewhat hoping for ""goes away completely"" like SARS and MERS.

"Supposedly the really deadly avian strains like warm temperatures and live deep in the lungs and don't become airborne easily.  The deep lung bit is what makes it especially deadly.   It spread through excrement.

The easily spread stuff likes cooler temperatures in the upper lung and becomes airborne easily. 

Even when ""bird flu"" gets into a human, it doesn't spread easily from human to human.  And it has made the jump to humans directly from chickens many times.  Very deadly, but doesn't spread easily from human to human.  

It's probably not going to be a big human threat until a strain learns to love both temperature ranges.  That's my big fear.",2022-03-13 22:27:21,austin,afraid

"Frankly, I don't understand how we haven't had runaway inflation for the past few decades with deficit spending, balance of trade, and all the Wall Street wizardry.  I really hope this isn't the time when we end up reaping the economic disaster we've sown for decades. 

However, there are a lot of recent problems that make it worse.   

Right winger or left winger, there have been a lot of big economic costs from COVID.  I think a lot of these costs are finally showing up in our pocketbooks. 

There have been around 1 million ""excess"" deaths in the USA, many of them involving long, expensive hospital stays.  Plus a large amount of medical expenses for those who didn't die.  Even without the effect of any mandated shutdowns.  That's a lot of economic damage to the economy that does trickle down/sideways to affect all of us.   

Businesses are finding staffing much harder, absenteeism, supply chain issues, quiet quitting, etc.   

The drought/heat wave has certainly been a big hit to food production.  

Lots of chickens were slaughtered during the bird flu outbreak.  

Runaway housing and real estate prices sound good to some people, but eventually the pyramid scheme runs out of new suckers, the music stops, the illusion vanishes, and most of us are left holding the bag. 

At the same time rent increases suck a lot of money out of the disposable income that powers a lot of the economy. Also the cash flow that business tenants need to hire people.  Then they pass that cost on to their customers.  

Then the government screws you double with the property tax increases. 

The Ukraine war hits a lot of things.  Wheat.  Fuel supplies.  War is expensive, taking a lot of resources out of productive use. 

Climate change is starting to have more and more impact on the economy.  Energy costs during the heat wave.  Impacts to food production from drought and heat. Storm damage and flooding.  Icepocalypse 21. Even when we DO do the right thing and take measures to mitigate CO2 production, that costs money and resources, too, especially short term. Corn ethanol production pulls a lot of food out of the food chain, increasing prices. 

I think there's a lot of economic pain backed up behind the dam and it's got to come out sometime.  I just hope we can trickle it out slowly rather than in a disastrous economic collapse.

People are so far removed from their food they have no idea what the price of production is. 

And I find it laughable when people complain about how much the grocery bill goes up and they have baskets that are like 60-70% corn wheat and chicken. Those three commodities have jumped so far above the price of inflation it’s not even funny that’s not due just to people being greedy.

There was another interview with a health official saying that the results they were getting from the other lab were wack, and that they wouldn't publish them until they had a longer line of data. My personal theory is that the results were just really high, as there seemed to be a ""second winter surge"" in January.

"Surely you find a difference between killing animals for food and killing animals for superstition? Additionally, while far from perfect, society as a whole has decided that even livestock animals have certain rights and protections. Sure, those protections are not respected more often than not, but the fucking compass is pointed SOMEWHERE, which is the avoidance of unduly pain whenever possible. Which is why chickens are electrocuted before slaughter, and cows stunted, and pigs killed with as much precision as possible. And sometimes when abuses do make it to the public, people go to jail and factories are fined. An amateur decapitating a dove they likely purchased from some crowded, unregulated backyard facility doesn’t take any of this considerations, they goal is indeed to cause the animal pain. Also noteworthy, birds are notorious for carrying viruses that easily make the animal-human jump, so regulated animal facilities go to great pains to monitor flock health, and medicate as needed or cull the entire flock in the presence of avian flu or other threats to human health.

"This has a lot more to do with avian flu. Less supply than demand, so prices go up.",2023-01-06 08:19:18,austin,concerned
"A big reason for the price increase is because they had to  kill over 100 million hens to stop the spread of avian flu.

https://www.kktv.com/2023/01/05/whats-causing-dramatic-increase-egg-prices/


Another  reason for the price increase - and not the only reason - is consumer demand for better treatment of egg laying hens.

 As of 2010, 97% of eggs are produced by chickens raised in battery cages. That means hens packed into cages so tight they can't even lift their wings or lay down, each bird allotted a space smaller than an 8 1/2"" by 11"" sheet of paper. Consumer demand forced a big change in the industry, now about 60% are produced this way and estimates are that by 2025 it'll be 30%.

 https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2022-02-10/cage-free-chicken-campaign-scores-surprising-success

That meant the industry had to spend the money to improve facilities for the hundreds of millions of egg laying hens.

Cage-free is a little better - instead of being crammed into cages they're crammed into barns with an average space for chicken of about three sheets of paper.  But they're still in unsanitary conditions, and develop new health problems. In addition, workers in these barns are experiencing respiratory issues from all the dust and chicken waste and also physical injuries from the ergonomic demands of having to gather eggs in a setting that's less of a factory than with caged eggs.

https://nyti.ms/29Y58As

Free range doesn't mean what most people think it does - it just means they have to have access to the outside. But that access can be a small door that the chickens don't even know is there.

https://www.eater.com/2019/7/17/20696498/whats-the-difference-cage-free-free-range-pasture-raised-eggs

Even in the best circumstances chickens are used up and discarded. A chicken in the wild lays about 20 eggs a year.  The commercial chickens are bred and fed a particular diet which forces them to lay as many as 250 eggs a year.

As you may have guessed, I don't eat eggs.

That position that went vacant is a senior position and I'm just a minion so I'm doing senior work for not-senior money. Also my cost of living raise was .06 cents.

COVID, MPOX, Ebola traveler monitoring, Avian Influenza monitoring (that's calling someone either daily or weekly and asking about symptoms for 20+ days).

"Sure! So, the “flu” refers to a group of viruses that are genetically related, but are not all identical. In fact, there are hundreds of different viruses that can cause the flu! There are a few hundred different breeds of dogs, so you can think of it like that - a dog is a dog, but there are hundreds of different kinds with distinct features, and there are also tons of possibilities of genetic mashups to make mutts. We can group dogs into categories; for example, large, medium, and small, or we could group them by function like tracking or hunting or novelty or whatever. You get the idea. We do the same with flu viruses; categorize them into functional groups. That’s why you might hear things like Flu A versus Flu B, or you might hear someone mention the H5N1 group versus H1N1, for example. 

Now, every year a group of smart, appropriately-educated and experienced folks use sophisticated computer algorithms to predict which of the hundreds of different strains of flu are likely to be the most prevalent in the upcoming season. Any given vaccine can only contain antigens from maybe four different strains of the flu (“antigen” is what we call an identifier that your immune system can use to recognize the virus; think of it like being given a photo of a chihuahua so you could later recognize that breed of dog if you saw one at the park). So each year the experts say, what are the four strains of flu that we are most worried about? Which are the top viruses that could make the most people sick this year, or that could cause the most harm in infected individuals? Once those have been identified, they are packaged up into a vaccine. 

The vaccine is very effective at preventing illness from those four top flu viruses. But, again, there are hundreds of flu viruses! Just like dogs though, some breeds are very similar to each other, so the flu vaccine can also be protective for many other strains that happen to be similar to the four included in the shot. And there are even more strains that are not similar enough for the vaccine to prevent disease; however, they are juuust similar enough for your body to go, “hmm, this seems familiar, I think I know what to do here!” and the illness is relatively mild or short. 

Plus, if you get a flu shot every year, then every year your body is learning about new variations of the flu. Even if the flu shot “wears off” after a while, your body at least has that experience under its belt, and in the future if you’re exposed to a variation of the virus that you were vaccinated for several years ago, you might get sick, but it may still be more mild than it would have been if you weren’t getting vaccinated. 

However, here’s the thing. There are still hundreds of these little suckers and every now and then, you’re going to encounter one that is totally new to your body, or is just some kind of mutt of a virus that your immune system doesn’t quickly recognize. If you don’t get vaccinated regularly, this is more likely to occur, but it can happen to anyone. When it happens, you get sick with the flu. Sometimes really sick. And it doesn’t matter whether or not you got your flu shot that particular year, because this virus is not one of the ones in the vaccine. It’s a random troll you picked up somewhere, and it’s going to take your body a while to mount a specified immune response and figure out the best way to get rid of it. And that is how, even after receiving the flu shot, you can still get the worst flu of your life. But it’s also the reason why you *should* get the flu shot every single year, to lessen the chances you will encounter a strain totally foreign to your immune system.",2023-08-02 12:36:09,austin,informative

A dairy worker in Texas was being treated for the virus that causes avian influenza, becoming only the second known human case in the United States, state and federal officials said Monday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the person tested positive for H5N1 bird flu.

The culled chickens at Cal-Maine Foods represent 3.6 percent of its flock as of March 2, it said. The company said “no farm is immune from HPAI” but added that it “remains dedicated to robust biosecurity programs across its locations.”

Minnesota officials reported the first infection of bird flu among livestock in the United States last month, when a juvenile goat living on a farm with infected chickens tested positive.

Last month, bird flu was also detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas. Later that week, U.S. officials said that cows in Michigan had tested positive and that there were presumptive positive tests among cows in Idaho and New Mexico, suggesting that the virus may be spreading among cattle.

On Tuesday, Michigan’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced that bird flu was detected at a commercial poultry plant in Ionia County, “the fourth detection of HPAI in a commercial facility” since the virus was first spotted in the state in 2022.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture also said Tuesday that cases were detected in a dairy cow herd in Idaho.

Officials have said the risk to human health remains low. But the CDC has warned that people with unprotected exposure to infected birds or other animals, including livestock, are at greater risk of infection.

People should also avoid uncooked or undercooked food, unpasteurized milk and raw cheese, according to the CDC. Cooking eggs or poultry to an internal temperature of about 165 degrees Fahrenheit generally “kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses,” it says. Backyard chickens or pet chickens are at risk if they come in contact with wild birds carrying the virus.

Human symptoms of bird flu include eye redness, fever, coughing, sore throat, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or seizures are less common, the CDC said.”",2024-04-03 12:29:20,texas,concerned

"In early February, dairy farmers in the Texas Panhandle began to notice sick cattle. Nearly 60 days passed before veterinarians identified the culprit: a highly pathogenic strain of the bird flu virus, H5N1. Had it been detected sooner, the outbreak might have been swiftly contained. Now it has spread to at least eight other states, and it will be hard to eliminate. 

Why did it take so long to recognize the virus on high-tech farms in the world’s richest country? Because even though H5N1 has circulated for nearly three decades, its arrival in dairy cattle was most unexpected. Tests for contagious diseases known to whip through herds came up negative. Some farmers wondered if the illness was related to ash from wildfires devastating land to the east.

An early indication that something had gone awry on farms in northwestern Texas came from devices hitched to collars on dairy cows. Darren Turley, executive director of the Texas Association of Dairymen, describes them as “an advanced fitness tracker.” They collect a stream of data, such as a cow’s temperature, its milk quality, and the progress of its digestion — or, rather, rumination — within its four-chambered stomach. What farmers saw when they downloaded the data in February stopped them in their tracks. One moment a cow seemed perfectly fine, and then four hours later, rumination had halted. “Shortly after the stomach stops, you’d see a huge falloff in milk,” Turley said. “That is not normal.”

In hindsight, Turley wished he had made more of the migrating geese that congregate in the panhandle each winter and spring. Geese and other waterfowl have carried H5N1 around the globe. They withstand enormous loads of the virus without getting sick, passing it on to local species, like blackbirds, cowbirds, and grackles, that mix with migrating flocks. But with so many other issues facing dairy farmers, geese didn’t register. 

Sometime in March, viruses appear to have hitched a ride to other states as cows were moved between farms. The limited genomic data available links the outbreak in Texas directly to others in New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota. However, the routes are imprecise because the USDA hasn’t attached dates and locations to data it releases.

Researchers don’t want to be caught off guard again by the shape-shifting H5N1 virus, and that will require keeping tabs on humans. Most, if not all, of about 900 people diagnosed with H5N1 infections worldwide since 2003 acquired it from animals, rather than from humans, Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at the World Health Organization said. About half of those people died.

Occasional tests of sick farmworkers aren’t sufficient, he said. Ideally, a system is set up to encourage farmworkers, their communities, and health care workers to be tested whenever the virus hits farms nearby.",2024-05-23 16:20:29,texas,concerned

"Because of the near 100 % mortality in wild birds (largely passerines)  and commercial chicken and turkey flocks ,and potential virulency when it jumps to humans (aout 50% mortality) global monitoring of of H5N1  and its ""cousins"" has been a top priority since the late nineties.  H5N1 highly pathogenic avian flu is highly mutable and often described as ""the big one"" by virologists and epidemiologists. Covid is referred to as ""preparedness practice"" for a H5N1 human pandemic.  I feel relieved that many countries are alert, have been historically prepared or beginning to prepare. Many have stockpiled somewhat effective antivirals and prototype vaccines. The vaccine use ""old technology' and would require many months to ramp up production...that is a worry.  I hope we are working on new fast technology vaccines.  

  
What can we do? 

1.Pressure the FDA and related federal agencies  to ramp up monitoring and reporting of H5N1 in wild mammals (48 species to date have been affected), in commercial animal stock including dairy and beef cattle, and pigs and goats. Infections in pigs are especially concerning as we share similar genetic vulnerabilities"" to many pathogens.

3. Begin informing and educating the public, and listening to farmers. I have been impressed with local responses in the chicken and dairy industry. Farmers are very worried . They need the latest information as it emerges. But I worry that politics and money will carry more weight than public health. the FDA and associated federal agencies have their heads in the sand about this.  The public needs to be better informed and risks. 

4. Always be personally prepared for epidemics and pandemics. 

  
Where to go for information?  

1. I go to PubMed , where you can find all scientific papers and government documents from every country. But the papers are difficult going. Still if you want to try - do a search on avian flu in humans and limit it to the year 2023- 2024. I also go to the virology chat rooms. The science is pretty heavy but you can see the science reported without fear of government repercussions .. remember what happened to the chinese scientists and doctors who tried to warn about Covid in late 2019?

2. The WHO is more informative than the CDC.  

3. Media? Its tough to separate the fact from the fake.  As a biologist who teaches students to separate science fact from fake science the media source that is most scientifically/medically correct is the New York Times science section. ..not the editorials.  Many of the other media sources are loaded with disinformation.

4. Science News is an on line journal that takes the latest science and reviews it for the public. Its excellent.

5. I find it most useful to do a google search on : Avian Flu and set the date screen to most recent. Glance through the headings from scientific, academic and health sites to get a feel about the global and local impacts. Do look at new reports from our agricultural belts. See what our farmers and ranchers  are experiencing .

6. Avoid social media and conspiracy websites .. you want the cleanest, least politicized science and medicine  so you can make the most informed decision.

Some commenters are very level headed, some are bordering on prepping for a big outbreak, some are convinced the world will end and everyone will die.

As of right now, I don't think there's any significant risk of infection UNLESS you actively work in a dairy/cow farm, chicken/poultry farm, or interact regularly with animals that have been confirmed to be infected with the virus. Also, if you are actively avoiding handling and consuming raw OR undercooked beef, eggs, chicken, milk, cheese, etc, your risk is extremely low.

From my understanding, the virus has not reached human to human transmission. All confirmed human infections are from people who interacted with sick/infected animals/spaces.

The virus does need to go through certain mutations to be able to become human to human transmissible.

ONE of these mutations has been confirmed, but it needs to go through multiple mutations.

IF the virus is detected in pigs, these mutations become more likely and the risk becomes greater.

Other animals interacting with infected farm animals have fallen ill with quite severe symptoms and have died, including farm cats as well as a domestic NON farm cat, so the virus may be spreading to other cats outside of these farms.

Owners should keep their cats indoors, and also make sure their dogs don't try to lick/eat bird poop or raw/undercooked beef/eggs/dairy(if you feed your pet a raw/freeze dried diet, this is a legitimate concern).

The CDC has highly recommended farm workers wear appropriate PPE, but they essentially said the CDC can f•ck off and that they won't take extra necessary precautions.

But, as of right now, in this moment and stage of the virus, I wouldn't be too concerned if you're being careful about what you and your pets consume. Maybe also avoid spending time with any friends or family that actively work on at risk farms if you want to be extra extra extra cautious. This would be moreso due to if they have virus particles on their person from farm animal feces/fluids that you could pick up, not so much about any human to human transmission risk.

Additionally, the appropriate entities have stated that an adequate vaccine specifically for H5N1 could be created in a matter of weeks with an expedited rollout in the event that it does become human to human.

The greatest risk is in those early weeks/months before people can get vaccinated, so at the earliest confirmation of any human to human spread, just make some life changes and be extra careful(we all know how different people will handle this stage based on the Covid pandemic).",2024-05-12 15:13:32,texas,concerned

"It is raging through farms but we don't know what the human version will look like: infectivity rate and a whole host of other factors. COVID was quite unique in its infectivity rate and the nature of its asymptomatic spread. In retrospect, it was impossible to contain.

Other outbreaks have occurred where the infectivity rate is low and you can only transmit when symptoms are showing. The diseases are still difficult to contain, but we do a much better job. Swine Flu raged a couple years ago.. it was bad, but nowhere near as bad as COVID.

With H5N1, we have some vaccines, therapeutics and tests. As I understand it, the Flu A tests works on H5N1. I am not saying that scientists have a handle on it, but they know a lot about this flu already. As I understand it, there are very few human cases.

It could take days or years for it to transfer to humans in a form that is more transmissible. No one knows.

The real worry is that meat and food prices in general will spike because of this outbreak on farms. In the past two years, the multinationals have been cutting production capabilities. So, the next hiccup in the supply chain means higher prices.",2024-05-12 19:02:05,texas,afraid

If not, you're fucked. I say you're fucked because any vaccine to H5N1 will be a mRNA vaccine and if you refused the COVID-19 vaccines it's highly probable you'll refuse this new vaccine. 

If you are current on your vaccinations, you'll most likely be fine because you'll follow common sense measures like social distancing, masking up in public and limiting your travel.",2024-05-12 21:40:11,texas,concerned
"I would probably be slightly concerned about feeding raw poultry or beef based foods to my pets since cats are confirmed to be vulnerable to the virus.

Commercial companies should be doing their own testing and due diligence to guarantee a safe and healthy product, but there definitely can be instances where something is missed or not properly cleared.

For instance, the local farm I buy my dairy from had an issue just recently when pasteurizing their chocolate milk and extended a recall and urged anyone who purchased the milk to return it for a full refund. Pasteurization neutralizes the virus.

It is a risk that the turkey in your pets food may be sourced from a farm that failed to properly cull/clear the virus from their flock before sending out bad meat and the pet food company may do their own testing but some bad batches may get out and be fed to pets before they catch it and issue a recall.

It's essentially a risk you have to decide if you want to take.

There are pet recalls on kibble based foods and canned foods. Sometimes, things just get through their protocols. I would personally consider raw pet foods to be a higher risk for now, though, just because of how widespread H5N1 seems to be across various farms and testing can't seem to keep up.",2024-05-12 22:40:29,texas,concerned

[Dr. Webby](https://www.stjude.org/directory/w/richard-webby.html) is a Flu researcher/expert at St Judes

Summary: Transmission of the current strain in cows is strange. It is not resperatory but seems to be passed from cow udder to udder in the milking area.  The strain does not have receptor binding domains for human or cow resperatory cells. The only documented cow to human case was conjunctividas because the human eye does have receptors for the strain. Cases in humans and other mammals are most likely under-tested and undercounted. 

The virus strain is deadly in ferrets. Ferrets are normally a good model for people disease, but not in this case.",2024-05-13 07:26:59,texas,concerned

Although human infections with this virus are rare, **approximately 60% of the cases have died.**

The majority of human infections with Asian HPAI H5N1 have occurred among children and adults younger than 40 years old. Mortality has been highest in people aged 10-19 years old and in young adults. 

Most human Asian HPAI H5N1 cases have presented for medical care late in their illness and have been hospitalized with severe respiratory disease. However, some clinically mild cases have been reported, especially in children.",2024-05-13 12:25:31,texas,concerned

I know other people have mentioned their disaster preparedness, but the way they handled the supply chain issues during the beginning of the covid shutdowns and the way that they handled that situation in store are part of what I love about them. There's a couple different [articles](https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/heb-prepared-coronavirus-pandemic/) from [Texas Monthly ](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/how-heb-became-emergency-preparedness-model/)that highlight some of the ways that they were more prepared to deal with an infectious disease pandemic than other stores (or the federal or state government). 

Some of the quotes from the March 2020 article looking at why they were better prepared and how they responded:

**""Justen Noakes, director of emergency preparedness, H-E-B:** Just a little bit of history: we have been working on our pandemic and influenza plan for quite a while now, since 2005, when we had the threat of H5N1 overseas in China. That’s when we first developed what our plan looked like, \[as well as\] some of our requirements and business implications. In 2009, we actually used that plan in response to H1N1, when [**the swine flu came to fruition in Cibolo**](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103744903), and refined it, made it more of an influenza plan. We’ve continued to revise it, and it’s been a part of our preparedness plan at H-E-B ever since.  

**Craig Boyan, president, H-E-B:** Justen leads our emergency preparedness with a group of folks, and that is a full-time, year-round position. We are constantly in a year-round state of preparedness for different emergencies. We keep emergency supplies at almost every warehouse and have water and other supplies staged and ready to go and kept in storage to make sure that we are ready to \[react quickly\] when a crisis emerges, whether it be a hurricane or a pandemic. We take being a strong emergency responder in Texas, to take care of Texas communities, very seriously.  

**Tina James,** **chief people officer, H-E-B:** For example, when we saw what was happening with the volume, we asked at corporate if people wanted to volunteer to take shifts in the stores and at the warehouses. We immediately had hundreds—800 corporate folks volunteered for 350, 400 shifts in our stores and warehouses, to be able to help out and give some relief to our stores. 

**Stephanie Lowe, customer**: I met Alma, who has been with H-E-B for 21 years, if I recall, and works in the store’s bookkeeping department. She had answered the “all hands on deck” call and was working checkout for the first time in years and she was so excited. She kept saying how much fun she was having being back at checkout and took great delight in looking up the codes to ring up produce. It was such a positive interaction in the midst of organized chaos, and I have thought about it throughout the week at work when things have been stressful.""

"It's a combination of de-globalization following covid and other general protectionism trends we've seen politically, rampant government spending, supply chain disruptions (from ukraine war, avian flu, etc.), and corporate greed.  Focusing on any one of these things just reveals your political bias.",2023-04-19 11:46:23,houston,concerned
Ah. I’ve been hearing about bird flu causing turkey shortages. Maybe the ducks got it too. Good luck!,2022-10-31 16:40:14,FortWorth,concerned
"Egg prices were already up 20% before the massive bird flu cull.
The price increases for the bird flu cull are just starting. I see egg prices going up another 15-25% by this summee.",2023-01-28 10:49:51,FortWorth,concerned
"I was there last week and many of the bird exhibits were closed due to the avian flu. Check their website before going to see if they have reopened them. Someone else mentioned a portion is closed for renovations but I think it’s still worth going. The zoo is huge and there is tons to see. Like someone else mentioned, I would plan to get there as early as possible. They also allow outside food so pack a picnic lunch to avoid buying food there. Same with water, make sure to bring a refillable bottle. Oh and wear comfortable walking shoes.",2022-05-01 23:05:48,FortWorth,informative
"Imagine talking down on someone having a job / their profession and not having the common sense to realize sitting in your car for 8+ hours, wasting gas and risking getting sick and wasting over all time that you could be working makes no sense… but go off… not to mention i cant imagine the quality of the turkeys considering theres a shortage and bird flu… also lets not forget if you’re on a budget there are other options for meals that are cheaper than a turkey… but not me using my brain or anything 😂
Also not that its any of your business. But i do OF for fun not income. Since i dont make any money doing it considering i run a FREE account
The 8+ hours someone spent waiting on a line… someone could have done doordash / uber eats and made $100… but why would people want to work these days",2022-11-19 10:03:13,Plano,skeptical
As someone who works at a grocery store… very much was a shortage. Perhaps you just got low quality turkeys that were affected by the bird flu and just are serving your customers low quality meat that can get them sick. Plus still dealing with shortages due to lack of labor during covid.,2022-11-19 11:31:38,Plano,concerned
Exactly. I remember one guy saying Bird Flu (which was big in the news at the time) would spread through Lubbock,2024-04-28 11:07:59,Lubbock,concerned
