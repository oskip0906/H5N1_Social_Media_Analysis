State animal health officials have quarantined the property in southern Wisconsin's Jefferson County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Milwaukee. All chickens in the flock will be destroyed and will not enter the food system, the USDA said.

Farms that raise turkeys and chickens for consumption have been on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity since avian influenza was recently discovered in a handful of states, including Indiana and Iowa. **Producers fear a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak in 2015 that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion**.

Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can spread from flock to flock by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.",2022-03-15 08:04:44,madisonwi,Fear,0.9997187256813049

This hardware cloth (steel) is buried about 1 foot into the ground around the run to discourage animals from digging under the fence/ This means wild birds cannot get in and share space / food with the chickens which greatly reduces risk of avian flu transmission.

"Well, because mosquitos are a very important part of the overall ecosystem. 

Mosquitos, and other biting insects, including bedbugs, Black Flies and fleas (among others), is how Nature takes energy from the top of the food change and sends it back down to the bottom. Upthread, folks were celebrating frogs, toads and dragonflies for their Mosquito-eating prowess. Guess what happens to those happy warriors when there are no more mosquitos? 

There are fewer frogs, toads, dragonflies, damselflies, salamanders, spiders and a host of other useful critters. And fewer of the critters that eat those useful critters (spiders get a double whammy here). 

Which will throw things quite out of whack. Other species that aren't mosquitos, which hatch in big bunches during specific parts of the year, will benefit greatly, because their predators, deprived of a regular diet of reliable mosquitos, will be few and far between. Their population will boom! Friendly critters like ticks, earwigs, crickets and others. 

Also, the bigger critters that eat frogs, toads, dragonflies, damselflies, salamanders, spiders and the host of other mosquito predators will also suffer. Fish, birds, snakes, and other forest dwellers. 

I approve of trying to reduce populations of disease-causing mosquitos. And also use Skeeter Dunks in standing water around my house. I further approve of efforts to eliminate invasive species of mosquitoes that are devastating rare bird species in Hawaii by spreading Avian Flu. 

But, overall, the little bastards are an important part of the natural balance. So I guess I'll resign myself to keep swatting the ones who are trying to suck my personal energy back down the foodchain, and think about the Circle of Life.",2024-06-16 11:44:25,madisonwi,Joy,0.9998745918273926

""This year’s deadly avian flu outbreak has busted through all previous records, killing so many birds that shortages are contributing to egg and poultry price increases for U.S. consumers who are already plagued by food inflation not seen in 40 years.

"Over 52 million birds have died as a result of the most recent avian influenza outbreak in the US. In Iowa, two massive egg-laying operations had to cull more than 5 million birds in single incidents earlier this year. Combine that with the winter storm supply chain impacts, and you have huge price increases not related to inflation. 

Edit to add: increased egg prices do drive inflation though.
