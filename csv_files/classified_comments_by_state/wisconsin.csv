"I hate to be that guy, but you’re really supposed to take down your bird feeders currently because of bird flu at the moment. Although, I’ve got a feeling that these folks might think bird flu is a Covid-type hoax.",2022-05-22 01:00:38,wisconsin,afraid
"Are we supposed to be feeding birds? I know there was a warning to take down feeders because of the bird flu. Is that not an issue anymore?

I haven't filled my feeders since last year because of the bird flu.",2022-05-22 11:56:43,wisconsin,frustrated
"Your feeling is wrong, they aren’t covid deniers at all and they’re not bird flu deniers. Everyone around here has feeders out. The feeders aren’t out there because they don’t believe in avian flu, I just think it’s not common knowledge to not have a feeder out. I hadn’t heard that before now and was actually planning to go get my first real one next weekend to set up when I’m working on my yard.",2022-05-22 12:00:04,wisconsin,skeptical
"Yeah I heard the same thing.  This morning I actually heard that if you find dead birds on your property with no clear cause you're supposed to report them to the DNR so they can test whether it was bird flu.  So as far as I knew it's still an issue.  I haven't been feeding or filling my birdbath, either...",2022-05-22 15:57:11,wisconsin,concerned

"Wife mentioned today eggs were around $6 for regular brands.  Looked it up and singe spring waves of bird flu have been going through wgg laying populations and those are driving up prices (along with increased fees costs and increased energy/fuel costs, and increased demand for more profits, etc).

Organics are competitive right now, but people will eventually notice the cost difference and increased demand will drive those prices up also.",2022-12-27 22:20:52,wisconsin,frustrated

"It makes some sense when you think about the reason for the price increase.

It's the caged birds that are a breeding ground for viruses, and they were worst impacted by this strain of bird flu.

"We aren't anti science. I've been receiving news about it since mid March when it was unknown what was the cause of disease was. The bird flu has a high morbidity but a low mortality. Causing low milk production in 2+lactation cows. The milk was thick and abnormal without a high high somatic cell count(SCC). A high SCC would indicate an infection.
There are no quarantines  between states because it's being passed by migratory birds.",2024-04-05 03:03:44,wisconsin,frustrated

"The bird flu didn't start in wild birds. It came from domestic chickens in crowded factory farm environments. Putting an end to animal agriculture is the only way to stop the spread of bird flu. If you're looking for someone to blame, think about who's actually responsible for the virus. I hope you're not supporting animal agriculture after this incident.",2024-04-17 10:13:04,wisconsin,concerned

"Bird flu has now infected dairy herds.  Bird flu has been transmitted to at least one worker on a dairy farm.  World wide more than 800 people are known to have contracted bird flu, the fatality rate for humans infected with bird flu is 52%.
The CDC is urging that people not drink unpasteurized milk, that veterinarians and people working in meat packing plants wear full protective clothing including goggles when coming in contact with the bodily fluids of cattle.  There are real health concerns about CAFO’s under normal circumstances, and even more urgent concerns with bird flu.

""This year’s deadly avian flu outbreak has busted through all previous records, killing so many birds that shortages are contributing to egg and poultry price increases for U.S. consumers who are already plagued by food inflation not seen in 40 years.

Here’s the situation report:

The highly pathogenic, highly contagious avian flu has led to the deaths of 52.7 million birds between February and December. That exceeds the previous record of 50 million during 2014-15.""",2022-12-28 05:55:09,wisconsin,informative
Apparently there is avian flu going around that is restricting the supply of eggs. That's probably why the price is astronomical.,2022-12-28 06:28:43,wisconsin,concerned
"So you’re not using planedemic to refer to covid then but the avian flu? Because that’s the only use I’ve heard of that word.

It did just hit me really how much the prices can change and how quickly. Two weeks ago when I got groceries I paid 6.83 for a carton of 18 and this morning when I placed my order the same eggs were 4.23. I know they can manipulate prices but that seems like a massive change for such a short period of time.",2023-02-10 08:21:26,wisconsin,skeptical
"That one to be fair is a product of the avian flu that hit the Americas. I live in England and I can still get half a dozen eggs for about $1.75 at my local store. Eggs may be the one thing we *don't* have crazy inflation on here yet, so it's interesting to see how bad it is in North America this year on that.",2023-02-10 16:33:59,wisconsin,informative
"Over 52 million birds have died as a result of the most recent avian influenza outbreak in the US. In Iowa, two massive egg-laying operations had to cull more than 5 million birds in single incidents earlier this year. Combine that with the winter storm supply chain impacts, and you have huge price increases not related to inflation. 

Edit to add: increased egg prices do drive inflation though.

"*“Although avian influenza viruses, first detected in humans in 1997, have caused outbreaks that killed hundreds of people, they have difficulty infecting human cells because of differences in the sugars that adorn human and bird cellular receptors for the virus. But humans have the bird version in our eyes, which explains why we can develop conjunctivitis.”*
