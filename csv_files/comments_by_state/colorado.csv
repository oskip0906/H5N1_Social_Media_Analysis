Pandemic 2: Bird Flu Boogaloo,2022-04-29 09:57:42,colorado
"You may be drawing a conclusion that isn’t exactly there. I am not sure if you are insinuating that farm bird are dying from the bird flu in such numbers because they are weak farm birds. 

I mean healthy chickens give good eggs, and I’m all for that.

That said, the current bird flu appears to be moving through wild birds pretty quickly, which are pretty organic all things considered. 


Various state agencies are requiring mass slaughter of large amounts of chickens (millions) to try and slow or stop the outbreak from reaching wild birds so that it stops spreading. I mean it already has but that is a side point. 

Anyways “we” keep slaughtering millions of chickens that aren’t necessarily infected or otherwise affected. If testing shows an infection in a area generally all are killed quickly. “We” are slaughtering millions of chickens to attempt to stem the spread to wild birds and other industrial farming places. Often under orders by the state. 

Now you might make the argument that bird flu is more likely to start and gain significant foot hold due to factory farming. However it appears that once it gets out to wild birds, it’s still going to kill large amounts of them. So I’ll ask, which  robustness are you talking about? 


Also I think you may want to check back in a month to see if your organic eggs are still unaffected, I assume you meant price wise. If not LMK.",2023-01-10 20:29:34,colorado
If a pandemic happens within the next couple decades I have a terrible feeling the human response will be less energetic than it was for Covid. Atleast for general populations…unless it’s bird flu. Hard to call it a hoax when a third of the people you know are dying,2023-02-13 20:46:55,colorado
"You seem to be putting words in my mouth. 

I have no problem with the industry not knowing about prions in advance. That's understandable: feeding cows mammalian proteins didn't have a harm that we knew of in advance, I had no objection to them doing that. Once it became clear though that mad cow was a possibility, the industry had a right to argue ""nah, lets ignore it, I'm sure its fine, cheaper hamburgers!"" but obviously the rest of society should have and did say ""absolutely not, you need to take steps to prevent mad cow tainting the food supply even if it costs more.""

Using bedding from chickens (I gather that's what's going on here) we evidently know to be a liability for spreading bird flu and it needs to stop. I don't blame the industry for using it initially if they didn't know it could cause human deaths to make slightly more profit, that's to be expected from any industry, but now we need to force them to stop doing it and we're fools if we don't pass laws stopping it.

I also have no complaint about inefficiencies leading to higher costs. I know I'm in the minority here but I do NOT think that it should be ""as cheap as possible"" if that ignores externalized costs like breaking antibiotics, spreading disease, and making the climate permanently unstable.

Saving five dollars off hamburgers at those ignored costs is not worth it to me. I'd much rather the meat industry do it safely (for the rest of the world) or not at all.

Again, that's on us, not the industry, to regulate it. We as a society are idiots if we don't pass laws banning antibiotics, the use of any and all technology to limit GHG (from livestock industries and all other industries) and implement a carbon tax as appropriate to be able to counter the effects of GHG externalized costs.

The meat and dairy industries won't do it on their own, except token gestures to get us to forget about it and think the problem is solved so they can keep maximizing profit. That's again not a complaint or criticism of those industries specifically, that is just their nature. Industries and companies are not real people with consciences.",2024-04-28 11:06:56,colorado
"Animal agriculture is more protected and insulated from regulation than the oil and gas industry. They get insane amounts of subsidies to hide the true cost of meat and dairy. They're able to prevent scientists from testing animals for bird flu. They actively spray piss and shit onto people's property. They rely on migrant workers, including children, who endure amputations and arthritic inflammation. They greenwash their outsized environmental pollution impacts by falsifying data on claims such as regenerative farming. Their products are carcinogenic, cause diabetes and heart disease, yet do not need to inform consumers of the health risks of eating their preferred diet of meat and cheese 3x a day.",2024-05-29 09:41:03,colorado
"Generally speaking I am not a big fan of large agricultural animal operations, but with respect to the bird flu stuff, they have incentive to not want to test because the current way it's handled requires them to kill all the birds if any test positive, even if most of the birds aren't sick and/or would have survived, to prevent spreading. It's not necessarily the best approach, IMO. Something that could be revised and would probably help decrease the incentive not to report that kind of thing.

I just read in the paper today that more than 4 million chickens in Iowa are being killed after it was detected at an egg farm.",2024-05-29 13:37:34,colorado
"I like horses and all, but feral horses are literally an invasive and destructive species in North America. Every year, their population increases by 25%, or 
doubles every four years. I say we need to actually properly cull these horses, not keep them in pens where they give each other a deadly virus. 

I mean, in the last decade alone, we’ve seen the swine flu, avian flu, and the coronavirus (which originally came from bats, then in the middle of 2020 there was a mink scare in Europe). If we just let a virus mutate among thousands of feral horses in BLM pens, there’s a real possibility we’ll have the “equine flu” pandemic too. 

It’s irresponsible to just let these horses stay where they are. They need to be adopted out, and the rest need to be euthanized. Maybe we should allow hunters to take out feral horses in the same way they’re allowed to take out Eurasian Collard Doves and European Starlings. Sorry, but it’s the truth…",2022-04-27 03:02:25,colorado
"Is the avian flu an outbreak yet, or just a single case?",2022-04-30 13:19:49,colorado
"From the article:

&gt;In Colorado, there has been one case of an individual contracting avian flu from an infected bird. The case occurred in Delta County this April, when an individual came in direct contact with diseased poultry by doing culling at a commercial farm. The individual did not experience any severe symptoms, and there was no other transmission following this.

I would also note that a Google News search shows other articles about this subject and it looks like the issue is with birds. It's a disaster for agriculture due to how contagious and potentially fatal this is for birds.

However, it  does not appear to be a major issue with humans at this time--certainly not the next COVID-19, if that's what anyone has in mind.",2022-10-09 09:35:55,colorado

"Merely tongue in cheek. Colorado is currently in the middle of an avian influenza AND an equine influenza outbreak (unrelated strains; avian is H5N1 and equine is H3N8).

We're all wiped out from COVID restrictions, but these hits keep coming and while these two outbreaks are mostly confined to animal populations, it's always ever a short genetic wiggle away from getting a foothold in the human population. Let's just say that these are the days you might consider donating a gift basket to your local epidemiologist.",2022-04-30 12:09:31,colorado
"Fuck paywalls

&gt;Raccoon kills eaglet in Front Range bald eagle nest that’s livestreamed via webcam
Eaglet that perished at Xcel Fort St. Vrain nest was six weeks old. A sibling eaglet survived, as did the parents.

&gt;A six-week-old eaglet was attacked by a raccoon and killed at Xcel Energy’s Fort St. Vrain facility near Platteville on Monday, Colorado Parks and Wildlife has confirmed.
The bald eagle family has a large following because two “eagle cams” are focused on the nest around the clock. Many follow the eagles via the Fort St. Vrain Eagle Cam Facebook group.
A second eaglet survived the attack, as did the mother and father. CPW said wildlife officer Mike Grooms responded to investigate 90 minutes after the attack.
“The camera showed a raccoon scaling to the top of the nest tree and grabbing the older, larger of the two eaglets from the nest around 7 p.m.,” the CPW statement said. “Wildlife officer Grooms was able to collect what remained from the carcass and delivered it to CPW’s Wildlife Health Lab, where officials will submit it for testing of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.”
CPW noted that the nest dates back to 1993 and the camera went online in 2003.
“What followers saw on Monday was a natural event,” the statement said. “Predation of eaglets is not something you often hear about. Without a webcam, such events are hard to document. The vast majority of nest failures in Colorado are attributed to weather events (such as windstorms that damage or destroy nests or nest trees), new nests/inexperienced pairs, the loss of an adult during the nesting season and potentially human-related disturbance in the immediate area.
“The most likely mammalian predator of bald eagles in Colorado’s Front Range are raccoons, while avian predators include magpies, crows and ravens, hawks and owls.”
Many fans of the Fort St. Vrain eagles have commented on the Facebook group page, expressing their sadness over the incident. The group has more than 4,000 members.",2022-06-01 15:49:54,colorado
"This is nothing major. H5N1 is already known to be transmissible between birds and humans. It has been for awhile now, it’s nothing new.

Now, if H5N1 evolved to be transmissible between humans?… that would be the article you should be afraid of.",2022-04-29 08:48:27,colorado
"First, the article says H5N1 isn't transmissible to humans. Not the same as H1N1 (swine flu) that was going around in 2009.
