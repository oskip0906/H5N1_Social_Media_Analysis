Bird flu is in the area.,2022-06-16 18:56:09,maryland
Double check if you go the the Susquehanna trails.  Some have been closed due to the bird flu,2022-07-14 20:04:57,maryland
"It's almost certainly not bird flu. There have not been known cases of the bird flu that is of concern spreading in the US. Here is more info.

"Iâ€™m kinda glad to see them.  Some years back, bird flu went through the region, and it literally decimated the crow population, killing 90% of them.  Itâ€™s good to see theyâ€™ve rebounded some.",2023-02-08 18:47:46,maryland
"Ah yes, the intense winter storms both coast are feeling has no impact on the majority of Americans. Not the droughts. Nor COVID. Definitely not bird flu causing chickens to be culled. Nor the collapse of entire food chains.

Nope. No impact at all.",2023-03-16 05:43:17,maryland
3 cats in the US have now tested postive for bird flu. Its spreading. It's also killed a lot of seals,2023-04-07 19:08:02,maryland
I hope itâ€™s not the bird flu starting to go around,2023-04-12 10:42:53,maryland
"The Brookings Institute has a nice summary [here](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-caused-the-u-s-pandemic-era-inflation/). 

Bidenâ€™s unprecedented pandemic era money giveaways were a major driver resulting in increased labor costs. Forget about the multiple billions that were stolen with few meaningful prosecutions. That barely reached the public consciousness. When you expand the money supply so dramatically this is a predictable result. 

Supply chain issues resulting from Covid and rising fuel costs also factor in. Bird flu in the poultry industry and other unique circumstances add to the phenomena for example. 

Iâ€™m also certain manufactures can slip in price increases virtually unnoticed under the cover of so many others sectors doing the same. So greed in the pursuit of padding hr bottom line plays a part. 

Industry consolidation over the last few decades is also coming home to roost. Less competition drives up prices.",2023-07-24 10:08:18,maryland
"Insurance is a function of ""whatever this repairs/replaces"". So if your used car is worth $14,000 when you got it and your insurance was $800,then the insurance is pegged off the current cost of that value.  That value, in a non-inflating market means your car depreciates and your insurance stays about the same.

In an inflationary market, the same car now costs $16,000 so your insurance as to match THAT cost.  

Cost of parts is high.

The three drivers to this, are not presidential, so dont blame Trump or Biden...

-The cost of fuel struck first and that has since been stabilized...but that impacted truckers and the supply chain all over...

-The cost of raw goods increased (eggs, milk, meats, wheat...each for different reasons, like Ukraine war destabilized wheat prices...Eggs increased because of multiple successive bird flu epidemics during covid that didnt even make the news...etc...

-Companies overcompensating for inflation which in turn doubled the increase...they are now getting pressure from you and I not willing to pay stupid prices for things...so as people stop buying at high prices, they have to lower prices",2024-06-15 15:18:03,maryland
"Got a troop of six of them that visit my house everyday, kinda fun to watch them bob around the yard looking for food. I do love hearing their songs as well. Hoping the avian flu leaves them unscathed.",2022-05-02 13:39:13,maryland
Birds were closed because of the avian flu. They are all back open except you cant go into the two aviaries. DC Zoo is awesome but its much more of a hassle to go there than Baltimore.,2022-09-05 19:14:49,maryland
"The Maryland Zoo is pretty meh in terms of zoos. Itâ€™s not terrible. But if thereâ€™s an avian flu thing going around, and you canâ€™t see the penguins, itâ€™s not worth going. Especially now that they got rid of the polar bears. The penguins are really the only attraction. So damn cute!",2022-12-11 10:24:58,maryland
"Well said, and I'd only add to your well written rebuttal that we're seeing cartel-like behavior from the food and fuel sectors. There is no shortage of egg laying hens, the avian flu didn't permanently destroy the egg industry, so why are egg producers bragging about 800% profit increases to shareholders while gouging consumers? 

The ability to eat basic foodstuff and heat one's home are not ""lifestyle choices."" The person you replied to has a spectacularly condescending attitude towards the working poor, as if setting your thermostat to an appropriate temperature or eating a fried egg was akin to buying a Hermes bag with public assistance money. This contempt for working class people is vile.",2023-02-02 09:46:23,maryland
Avian fluâ€¦ or eating poisoned rats an/or mice?,2023-04-07 11:30:24,maryland
Very odd. They tested positive for Avian flu and the article suggests they were transferring it because the vultures were eating other vultures carcasses. Vultures feeding on their own kind is pretty rare. They must have been absolutely starving.,2023-04-07 12:20:14,maryland
"Just toss me out of the car up at Connowingo and let the vultures handle it, I'm avian flu free, so that should be a nice treat for them.",2023-04-17 09:29:19,maryland
"Complicated. Main force appears, paradoxically, to be hunting. Live decoys are/were used, eggs gathered and hatched to increase population. Someone here will know better. Combine that anthropic force with the other ones of greener lawns, less hunting, warming winters and if you want geese, that is how you get geese. Will be exciting when human-goose exposure leads to a bad avian influenza spillover.",2022-10-22 15:11:36,maryland
"Itâ€™s not, theyâ€™re finding it in mammals (go to the H5N1 sub and youâ€™ll find articles)",2023-04-07 13:31:16,maryland
"This made me giggle. ðŸ˜„ I doubt it, but I've heard that H5N1 has been making the rounds.",2023-04-12 10:46:21,maryland
H5N1 looking more serious it should come up.,2024-05-15 13:19:50,maryland
Anyone watching H5N1 spread throughout the dairy industry probably will.,2024-05-16 08:29:07,maryland
"They might - but the same thing applies to Hogan here as it does for everything else - the things that he's good on are generally (to Marylanders) things where his party is out of touch.

Giving the party of COVID denial the majority just because Hogan was good with COVID wouldn't make alot of sense.

Ultimately if H5N1 becomes a big thing Biden and Dems are probably toast anyway - the economic impact of another significant disease emergency just before the election would overrule any actual analysis of who did better handling COVID. Hogan might even have a shot in that case.",2024-05-16 09:55:14,maryland
