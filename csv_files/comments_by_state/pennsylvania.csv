Also, animals do cycle through exhibits and may have to be taken off exhibit. Many birds are not in outdoor exhibits right now due to avian flu too. And lastly... Animals hide and need privacy. They may be in there, just hiding away though.",2023-07-26 15:30:22,pittsburgh
"Well since the Avian Flu is threatening large portions of our livestock (and maybe us next) and nothing is really being done quickly about it, maybe it's something that should be looked into.

"Agreed. Plus more activist type communities should be supporting health, prevention, and mitigation of their true to their inclusive morals. Asking people to wear a mask for an hour or two is not a big deal and would keep the band safer and everyone else safe. Wish I had known about this before they dropped the reqs. There is so much misinformation, denial, and apathy in these comments alone regarding covid, masks, and vaccines in general, and we wonder why people are sicker longer and more often, why people are flakier, angrier, more impulsive. Our own gov and health authorities are letting us down, public health has become individualized and politicized. We‚Äôre on the brink of Avian Flu which is even deadlier jumping to humans, and it all boils down to cognitive dissonance, laziness, and the refusal to do something mildly inconvenient for a short period of time.

I've seen feedlots for pigs and cattle, and I frankly would rather have meat grown in a lab.  Free-range and grass-fed isn't too bad when it's not just gaming the system and actually involves some range, but it also consistently produces less flavorful/tender beef that some people just don't end up liking that much.",2024-05-02 19:11:32,pittsburgh
"The only thing I'll add regarding the zoo; I don't know if this'll be true depending on how early in April that OP is going to visit, but they have no birds outside. No eagles, flamingos, penguins, emus, not even the wandering peacocks. The indoor bird exhibit is closed. Signs say it's due to strains of bird flu found in other parts of the US.

Leave the bird alone. I'm sure hes fine. I am a bird lover. I would never pick up a sick bird. You take dead birds to get checked for bird flu not live ones.

This is the primary driver for inflation in chicken prices. Due to avian flu we are culling millions of chickens. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/28/egg-factory-avian-flu-chickens-culled-workers-fired-iowa,2022-07-03 07:56:11,philadelphia

This wasn‚Äôt the answer though. We went in 2021 when all the outside birds were first brought inside. It was because of avian flu. I think the birds died or they got rid of them. They had new meerkats recently and they also all died from some mysterious virus. The bears are leaving this year as well.

"I don't see how my comment lacked nuance, but let me try again...

The real problem is that COVID is not a *major* virus, but it's also not a *minor* virus. A *major* viral pandemic would be something like H5N1 (the one most of us in the research community have been worried about for the last decade-and-a-half). The case fatality rate of H5N1 is close to 60%...so we wouldn't be talking about millions of dead, but more like *billions* of dead.

At the same time, COVID's case fatality rate is still greater than *literally any other currently circulating disease*. It's greater than HIV (with modern treatments). Without vaccination it's greater than malaria. Even *with* vaccination it's in the same ballpark as malaria, and malaria has a much more limited range. 2 years into the pandemic, and the statistics just recently released show that for those age 45-54, COVID was the leading cause of death in the US...more than cancer, more than heart disease, more than car accidents.

So, calling COVID ""minor"" depends heavily on how you define that term. If I asked you if a 1% case fatality rate was ""minor"", maybe you'd say yes. In that case, COVID, at a case fatality rate of somewhere between 0.1% and 0.05% would qualify as ""minor"".

But would you call the communicable disease with the highest case fatality rate of any disease currently circulating in the human population ""minor""?

...I guess it's all relative.",2022-07-16 01:25:49,philadelphia
"Did you read the article you posted?  Where it talks about the specific reasons behind the prices and shortages for that specific area, such as the nationwide bird flu epidemic that killed off a large portion of the chicken population, or the proposition that passed in, again, *California* that put guidelines in place for how many chickens could be raised with a certain amount of farmland?

Which of those was Biden most responsible for, would you say?",2023-08-03 13:52:06,Erie
