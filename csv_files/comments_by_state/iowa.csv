&gt; Iowa poultry farms prepare for highly-contagious bird flu.

&gt; Poultry farms in Iowa are watching closely, as the highly-contagious bird flu spreads across at least seven states on the east coast.

&gt; An avian flu outbreak in 2015 cost Iowa almost 8,500 jobs and more than $1 billion in economic activity, according to a study commissioned by the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation.

&gt; ""I mean, it's tough on them.""It's believed the virus is spread through migratory birds, which means Iowa could see cases later in the season.

"It kills the birds and jumps to pigs, then humans you know those times where a lot of people die from the flu. That's because bird flu jumps from pigs to humans and presents with antigens that the majority of the public do not have immunity to. You cook your meat, but novel flu strains will cook our population. And those nut jobs at the beginning of COVID saying the regular flu is deadlier than COVID we're right when we talk about bird flus that make the leap.

Also, they don't even have to make the leap directly. Influenza virus does this really cool thing in host tissues where they can recombine their genetic info with other strains of flu in those hosts so even if the bird flu strain does not make the jump, the proteins that make it scary can.

But the largest concern is that it kills birds. If birds die you.cant fucking cook them and eat them. As such, poultry producers are required to kill flocks that even a single bird tests positive in. That can be millions of birds in a flock. That means millions in losses for the company and, well. No chicken on the store shelves.

Cool, you cook your meat.",2022-03-03 22:44:55,Iowa
"Rare cases it transmits to humans and causes death/serious illness. But the biggest thing is if it mutates/bad strain for the birds themselves. Bad strains can kill 90+% of all birds infected. Not a very good way to profit.

"The issue is that influenza has 6-8 strands of RNA in each virion, so if you have human influenza and you're exposed to bird flu, it'll mix and match every possible combination of those strands and see if something sticks. Bird flu as it exists right now is a very rare occupational hazard, but it's exceptionally good at creating a severe pandemic virus. I'd be 1000x less worried about this if a general influenza vaccine saw wide adoption. The good news is that current human influenza isn't all that infectious so a moderately effective vaccine that protected against all current and adjacent-possible human strains would pretty quickly wipe it out even without a ton of uptake.",2022-03-04 00:18:02,Iowa

"This is an awful post about the bird flu and what's going on with it. It makes it seem like the chickens were burned alive. That's not true. 

Also carbon monoxide is very humane. The birds just go to sleep. They don't suffer. 

The have to burn the chickens after death to stop the spread. They virus can be spread from dead chickens. If another bird ate a carcus that had the flu, they could get the virus then pass it on to other birds. It's not just a chicken virus. It's effecting geese, ducks, pheasant etc. 

Also the difference between 2015 and now is that the virus started as highly pathogenic where as 2015 it started as low and moved to high during transmission. So the virus is very much worse now than before. This is probably why they suggested other jobs to workers. Trying to repopulate barns is difficult. You can't merge 2 flocks for fear one could have the virus. There's more biosecurity measures involved now. And trying to get pullets that are ready are expensive and take time. Sometimes months or even up to a year.

They also could have suggested other jobs if Rembrandt is remodeling barns. Egg facilities have to go to cage free systems. So if they decided they are going to remodel during the bird flu epidemic, they don't need laborers to manage birds.

"This is the more important part of the legislation, and the part they need to be leaning into harder:  


""When natural disasters like bird flu and extreme weather strike, industrial livestock operations incur huge losses. These losses are too often shouldered by contract farmers, rural communities, and government,” said Craig Watts, former contract poultry grower and field team operations director, Socially Responsible Agriculture Project. “It’s time we stop allowing multibillion-dollar corporations to externalize the cost of their high-risk operations. The Industrial Agriculture Accountability Act shifts the burden to where it belongs: the backs of Big Agribusiness.""  


Historically the smaller family farms were naturally more humane and more environmentally friendly, not in a hardcore environmentalist kind of way, but their operations were just naturally less destructive, and they fished the waterways and their kids drank from the wells. The problem is the big industrial operations, which need regulated, and the state legislature desperately needs to get off it's ass and look at taxing commercial operations whose owners don't live in the state or even the country at a higher rate to give local operations a better chance.",2022-11-23 18:47:02,Iowa

"1. you're mistaking the why. They do not want to set a timeline because then there is a burden for the patient to 'prove' that they fit the very narrow guidelines. We saw clearly with the Cox case how women are treated when their health is in danger. This doesn't mean they actually happen during those later weeks. Less than 1% of all abortions are late term. Women in general would not carry a fetus for 8 months just to abort. That doesnt make any sense and is why the vast majority of them happen early on.

2. Being impoverished and in danger is a valid reason to seek asylum, which again, you used to be able to do at any crossing. We helped create the system that left these nations impoverished. We profited from it. It's our responsibility to deal with this in a humane way. 

3. Biden isn't responsible for the inflation, and he isn't responsible for it going down now. Even the egg industry, which had a valid reason to raise prices due to bird flu, artificially inflated their prices. Every study i have read has admitted that corporate greed has contributed significantly to this pricing. Otherwise...how would you explain that many of these companies that have inflated their products have also posted record profits?

4. Are you a medical professional that has the credentials to decide that gender dysphoria, and by extension, transgenderism is a mental illness?

If egg prices don't go down in a year, you will know that this was a premeditated conspiracy to keep prices high. Monopolizing egg production and distribution will do that. It allows a few big players in any one market sector to essentially control prices for maximum profits.

This is no different than the oil market jacking up gas prices and yet no one ran out of gas, there were no lines, there was no shortage of gas.

I remember 1973 and the Arab oil embargo. That was a real shortage of gas. Gas stations ran out. Gas lines went for a mile at gas stations that had gas. The economy shut down due to lack of supplies being transported.

I just think they are not behaving like geese and may end up being injured by this.

I think eventually there is an overpopulation problem.  Looking at how well they have rebounded and how quickly this is a guess on my part.  In a city / suburban setting and with a law prohibiting (generally although Iowa DNR has exceptions available to them) human intervention other than simple discouragement there can come a time where disease threatens the geese and possibly other species as well.  Should they for example become impacted by the avian flu it will be bad for their population - overall.

"Maybe we misunderstood the question, are you wondering specifically why chicken prices have outpaced other food items? The USA has had bird flu outbreaks in 2020, 2021, 2023, and 2024. This year’s bird flu is especially bad. Demand for wings has also been increasing over the past few decades. Chicken’s going to stay expensive for the next few years.

So no, I really can’t think of anywhere with decent cheap wings. The Down Under is about the cheapest place I’ll go. I think Fawn’s, Bailey’s Pub &amp; Grub, Leachmon’s Pit Stop, and Basic Bird are all worth the high cost.",2024-04-22 21:57:15,desmoines

"6 kids...1 @ St Lukes, 2 @ Mercy, 3 @ UofI

St Lukes (unity point) - Dedicated birthing building...lots of curb appeal, lots of snob appeal. Our birthing nurse was amazing. Born in an ice storm, so she stayed quite awhile. After she left it all went to shit. Every other nurse was competing either for the beeotch-supreme award or the biggest shoulder shrug trophy. Granted it was our first time, but lactation difficulties, and a collicky baby left us needing some help. They just kept repeating ""have you tried feeding him?"". Yes, yes, and four more times after that, yes. Never once offered supplementary formula. Never once offered anything besides have you tried feeding him and/or shoulder shrugs. Literal f'ing shoulder shrugs. It didnt get any better until our peditrician showed up and started bossing nurses around. Baby lost more weight than it should have...but why not, he was starving...our fault of course...why you ask? ...*shoulder shrug*

Side note -  Before baby #2 we did a pre visit at St lukes and Mercy. They were so beeotchy during the visit it was clear how it was going to go so we went with Mercy. This all happened during some lame lesser bird flu outbreak in Canada or some such nonsense so all birth suites regardless of hospital were saying no more than 2 'visitors'. A buddy of mine had a baby at St lukes during that time. Grandparents came for a visit, he went out to the waiting room to get them...they wouldnt let all 3 go back...Dad isnt dad, he is a visitor. Stupid, but fine. He tried to wait in the waiting room, hospital staff said he couldnt wait in building, had to go outside. Dude was wearing panjama bottoms and a tshirt - it was dead of winter. Asked if he could get his coat? Nope, leave before we call security. Doesnt want to cause trouble, stands outside as close to door as possible so he can catch a little warmth. Security comes out and makes him stand on the far side of the driveway. So he cant cantaminate the building he was just in. He got wise real quick...bundled up and put a lawn chair outside the suite window so he could still be part of the experience and see his parents see the baby for the first time and such. Meanwhile, Mercy at that time counted Dad as dad and I got to be in the room even with 2 visitors :)

Mercy - 2 babies, amazing experiences with both. Dad got treated like a human being instead of a nuisance. Mom got taken care of very well - still a little trouble lactating? How about we try some supplementary formula! Oh snap - baby was past birth weight when we left, everyone got more sleep, not one single nurse shrugged at me...not one! Every time there was a question there was an answer or an attempt to find an answer! Food was indeed good. Couldnt have been happier with Mercy and had 2 children there!

...wife decided along the way that she wanted to try all-natural, and wanted to use a mid-wife program instead of the ob-gyn. So, the next 3...

UofI (midwife program) - efficient, we were driving a bit and waited too long. Baby #5 came out 4 minutes after arrival, no one but the closest nurse in the room...still went just fine :) Overall, I would compare as very close to Mercy...slightly more clinical astetics, Mercy was more cozy, but otherwise fine. UofI is a research hospital, so they will ask for permission to bring students in and allow them to do rudimentary tasks and check ups after the birth. I always said yes, I kinda liked having a gaggle of people looking after my kid as opposed to our st lukes experience. P.S. not even those students answered a question with a shrug.",2022-08-22 21:37:19,cedarrapids

"I would be cautious due to the current avian flu outbreak. If you are not experienced with chickens do you know how to recognize illness?
