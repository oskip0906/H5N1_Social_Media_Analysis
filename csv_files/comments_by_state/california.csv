Is there any year where bird flu doesn’t infect bunch of chicken farms and wild birds?,2022-10-30 17:10:46,california
"This is over 2 months old, but it's only gotten worse in California. 

Bird flu has been detected in domestic flocks in both NorCal  and SoCal. 

It's showing up in wild flicks with birds dying and being taken to bird rescue groups.

Take down your bird feeders.",2022-12-21 16:36:10,california
"For everyone commenting who obviously didn’t read the article (or the whole headline “hard to find [bird flu]”)

“The cause is an unprecedented outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza — commonly known as bird flu — that has killed tens of millions of egg-layers nationwide. Among these are millions of cage-free hens California relies on to comply with Proposition 12, the 2018 animal welfare initiative that took effect last year.”",2023-01-07 12:27:56,california
Read the article. A new outbreak of bird flu caused the loss of millions of egg producing hens. There’s an actual shortage of eggs not price gouging.,2023-01-07 14:48:14,california
"Man I would give anything for my little one to eat eggs! I’m so jealous.

(Oh yeah and the bird flu thing is bad too)",2023-01-07 21:10:27,california
I read the article. Solves the mystery I've been going through of why are eggs so expensive. It's a bird flu that has killed many millions of chickens and the chickens won't be replaced for several more months. Looks like more frozen breakfast foods for me. I'm not paying a 'premium' price for a cheap food. I know it's uncontrollable but still.,2023-01-08 06:08:46,california
"So long as bird flu is raging through poultry farms, prices will stay up. The reason is that all the birds must be culled if one gets sick. Nationwide more than 50 million chickens have died leading to shortages of eggs and other poultry products.

A bigger danger is if H5N1 jumps to other livestock. Then things get grim.",2023-02-06 16:53:08,california

"Just being real. 

They try to capture each condor once a year and weigh them and do blood work on them, and too often they have to treat them for lead poisoning.

And in Arizona several Condors have died from bird flu. Luckily there's now a vaccine, so they're now treating the California-based condors with the vaccine.",2023-08-30 12:06:38,california

My pet chickens had the bird flu last year. They all survived,2023-12-15 18:44:58,california
Then I shouldn’t care about anything else unless it involves nuclear warfare by your own perspective. Even if the bird flu becomes an epidemic among people.,2023-12-27 19:07:18,california
I heard some sort of bird flu required culling millions of chickens which impacted egg prices. Does not seem strange.,2024-01-06 14:48:48,california
Corporate greed. Doesn’t change the fact that the reason eggs prices went up is because of the bird flu.,2024-03-19 17:34:10,california
"So please explain with scientific evidence how a cow that is a bovine and a mammal can get bird flu, birds are not mammals so how can a cow that a herbivore get virus from a bird that could infected?",2024-04-14 14:20:05,california
How do humans get bird flu?,2024-04-14 14:34:59,california
Who could have possibly known that feeding ground up infected chickens to cows could give them bird flu?,2024-04-14 19:51:20,california

"Once we are passed all the avian flu stuff, I can’t recommend enough the window suction feeders (Amazon $12-20). They’re made of acrylic (boo hiss to plastic, but…), so you can see absolutely everything when they visit the feeder.",2022-12-14 11:02:38,california
"We’re going to see a lot more mammalian deaths from Avian flu in wildlife as it continues to spread globally. Specifically among mammals which eat the carcasses of dead birds. Given that we’re seeing it on every continent at this point, and to a growing variety of mammals, it’s probably safe to say that’s going to continue happening. 

Now bobcats aren’t people. Sea lions aren’t people. Foxes aren’t people. Mink aren’t people. And so far transmission to humans is rare. However now is a good time for people to be taking extra caution around wildlife and poultry production. This isn’t just farming, but also hunting. Now would be an exceptionally poor time for hunting birds, especially for consumption, unless you have some way to test for avian flu in the bird prior to doing so. 

there’s no reason for serious concern at this point provided simple precautions are taken. However precautions are warranted. We know mammal to mammal transmission is possible, we’ve seen it in sea lions and mink. We know bird to human transmission is possible. As long as we’re cautious, hopefully we won’t see human to human. 

If we *do* see human to human, there isn’t necessarily any reason to panic, but again, exercising caution and adopting pandemic-like measures of masks in public, etc would offer a measure of personal protection and perhaps peace of mind.

It should also be noted that we have several currently effective avian flu vaccines. The downside is they mainly require chicken eggs to incubate, but unlike with covid, we have ready to deploy measures.",2023-02-24 16:48:09,california
"I've got a couple of wildlife rescue groups in my Facebook feed. They're all following special protocols with their bird intakes, even though they haven't found any with Avian Flu yet.

And zoos are taking special precautions with their bird collections too because of Avian Flu.",2023-04-15 13:35:54,california
"Yes, very nice little zoo. Unfortunately, a lot of our bird exhibits have been shutdown due to Avian flu.",2023-04-15 14:24:34,california
"Nothing specifically about California. 

&gt; The disease has been found in northern Arizona, among the bird’s Southwest flock, which straddles the Arizona-Utah border, says the service. Avian flu has not yet been confirmed among any condors in Utah, California, or Baja California, Mexico.

"Well, the public isn’t geniuses, for one. I hope the lessons learned during the COVID pandemic were learned, shared, and acted on. We are looking at a nasty variant of the avian flu crossing over to humans, here soon. Fingers crossed it doesn’t, but, we are in the, Find Out Century. 

Public lesson: don’t wait for a catastrophe to happen to be prepared. Get a stock of toilet paper, canned goods, and water. We are bound to have an earthquake or another pandemic at this rate. Be prepared my fellow Californians. Be prepared.",2023-09-10 18:51:47,california
Remember when they acted like there was a shortage last year when there was no shortage and price fixed? Good times. Guess we taught them they can cry avian flu and Jack up the price of eggs.,2024-01-29 07:56:16,california
"Egg prices increased because one farm was hot hard by an avian flu, so they had to raise prices.


Then everybody else was like, good idea and raised their prices accordingly. ",2024-03-19 07:55:15,california
"Egg prices jumped because of the avian flu and they had to slaughter millions of birds. Number of cases of bird blu in humans has been low, but it killed around 39% of the people that caught it so they really don’t want it to spread to other animals then spread to humans.",2024-03-19 17:05:36,california
