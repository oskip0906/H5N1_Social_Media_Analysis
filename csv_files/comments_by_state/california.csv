"You didn‚Äôt wear a mask during swine flu, bird flu, or any other bad flu season and there were immunocompromised people back then too.",2022-02-08 04:41:19,LosAngeles
"Let me preface this by saying I don‚Äôt give a shit whether people wear them or not.

I‚Äôm with you man but calling mask wearing during a pandemic a dystopia really detracts from your original point and makes you look nutty. Especially saying that we weren‚Äôt wearing masks before for ‚Äúthousands of years‚Äù. We also didn‚Äôt use soap, antibiotics, or GPS. GPS can track you. D Y S T O P I A. We also used masks during the Spanish flu outbreak. Asia used masks during the SARS and bird flu outbreaks. 

I agree that people are frustrated bc the state handled this all wrong from the jump. Government inefficiency is the real dystopia. And we can‚Äôt wear masks for ever, that shit is unrealistic. There is definitely a status quo made for wearing masks and I think in some cases there is over policing.

But using that word because it affects you way less as a healthy adult while others don‚Äôt want old and immunocompromised people to die is over the top. My friends and family have waited weeks and months for bodies that couldn‚Äôt be processed in a timely manner because of how many dead there were in the moratoriums and cemeteries. Shit was real. Not a dystopia. A reality.

That being said, it‚Äôs time. People have picked their side: vaxx‚Äôd or not. I think it‚Äôs fine to not require masks in places that aren‚Äôt medical centers or have concentrations of people with weakened immune systems. I think it‚Äôs fine to allow people to not wear them as long as they aren‚Äôt sick. Maybe the vax turns us all into 5G zombies, maybe the unvaccinated fuck around and find out. It is what it is now.

100% of the people I see calling this a dystopia literally just don‚Äôt want to wear a piece of cloth over their face rather than actually have substantive criticisms of the mandates and lockdowns. Not saying that this is or isnt the category you fall into but throwing around ‚Äúdystopia‚Äù really sends that vibe.

Also saying you‚Äôve been here for 20 years doesn‚Äôt mean anything. I respect the opinion of anyone who has been here to experience the pandemic as worth discussing and if you want to use being ‚Äúgrandfathered‚Äù into an area as your opinion being more valid, most people in the city outrank you.",2022-02-09 18:29:09,LosAngeles
"There is a lot of talk about the mask mandate ending for travelers, specifically on airplanes, but when the next flu like disease hits, i have a feeling a lot of people will get it because there is a huge disdain for masks here. Unlike in asia where mask wearing became the norm after bird flu in the early 2000s, we will probably be burning them soon.

"I was going to answer your post in yesterday‚Äôs thread but I fell asleep üôÉ  
I was just in San Diego this past week. My friend and I went to the Birch Aquarium, the Natural History museum, and the Safari Park.  The Natural History museum is within the large, beautiful complex of Balboa Park. There were so many other museums that we wanted to go to but just didn‚Äôt have the time (seemed like they all close at 5p).   
The aquarium was enjoyable as well and the Safari Park is amazing. A lot of the bird exhibits are empty because of the bird flu, which is sad but also makes it easier to do the park in one day (depending on how long you like to stay at each exhibit).

It CAN be transmitted to humans who handle infected birds, and it's very serious in people.

I have pointed out the fault a few times now in the knee jerk reaction to blaming price increases on ""the corp"" without understanding what went into it. For example when I brought up the chicken genocides, why do we kill the whole flock when one gets avian flu? Why doesn't the FDA mandate quarantine procedures.

"It's because restaurant owners are worried that the market isn't ready for the actual cost of food. Years ago David Change wrote an article in GQ about how his $17 bowl of ramen really ought to cost $28, but the market wasn't willing to bear that price difference, and no one would come to eat it if he charged what he really needed to to keep that dish appropriately profitable. That was maybe 10 years ago, and the truth has remained the same. A workaround, which I also agree is disingenuous and a little shady, is to start adding these fees. 3% or 5% here and there isn't so bad. But it's quickly gotten out of control especially since COVID.  
  
COVID did a number on the restaurant industry as well. 4 years ago a case of eggs (180 ea), cost $40 a case. When the avian flu hit the egg producers 2 years ago, that price more than doubled. It was one of the major reasons The Nickel Diner couldn't remain open. Supply chains destroyed any predictability in getting proper goods. The EXTENSIVE limitations to styles of service and limited staff willing to work also destroyed many restaurants. All the smaller businesses lost out on the PPP loans to the larger more legally equipped counterparts.  
  
Yes, there are bigger investor-backed restaurants that can be greedy or whatever, but I guarantee you the people who love this business, like myself, are seeing fewer and fewer opportunities for growth and sustainability. I think we're going to see a reduction in style of service, like counter service style places instead of a server coming to the table, slimmer menus with fewer unique options, and a ""blanding"" effect of the entire industry.  
  
While I agree the fees are silly and are out of control, I'm also concerned guests will get some real sticker shock when a lot of restaurants, mine included, will have to increase their prices by a noticeable amount in July, which will lead to an extreme drop in business.

"Industrially produced eggs are *very* dependent on energy, grain, and soy costs. Picture a long metal shed the size of a football field full of birds. Gotta vent out the shit fumes. You need artificial lighting that simulates daylight to keep production consistent through the winter. With the high density of most industrial operations you might even need actual HVAC in an area like Petaluma. 

You also need feed. A lot of it. That's grain and soy, but grain prices are high because of the invasion of Ukraine. Grain prices are also high because corn or wheat are nitrogen intensive crops; natural gas is the main feedstock for nitrogen fertilizer which is also an energy intensive process to create. Then it all needs shipping.


$7/doz is probably high for an industrial operation but their production costs have absolutely gone up.


The avian flu thing is another big part of this. Industrial meat brids are slaughtered at around 42 days. You're 3 weeks away from fertilized eggs hatching and 6 more weeks away from slaughter. Laying birds take months before they start producing. 0-5ish months is basically all cost, then 6ish-24ish months is when your birds are productive for marketable eggs.


If you have to slaughter all the birds at a site when they're 14 months old you're losing your birds at peak production and you're losing them 10 months early. In 3 weeks + ~5 months you had planned on buying replacements but now you need to buy early and if you amortized costs across a bird's life you lost over half of its productive time.

$7/doz may still be high because you're buying at a convenience store, but there's actually difficulties in egg production that have everything to do with production costs.",2022-11-27 21:14:11,Sacramento

There was a small supply change (something like 45 million chickens died), but there are *a lot* of chickens in America. *Ten billion* chickens almost.

"All I can do is laugh and laugh and laugh and then cry at these annual Covid super spreader events. You may think you're done with the pandemic, but the pandemic is certainly not done with you. It's really tragic that people receive no correct information from public health bodies about the risks going around right now with Covid, H5N1 (our very own real life soon to be Captain Tripps, thank you Prophet  Stephen), Dengue fever, tuberculosis, measles, Marburg , scarlet fever, whooping cough, leprosy, you know all the Victorian shit that's  back and going around right now in 2024? 

A reminder that over one million cases of Dengue fever exploded out of Brazil and are racing north towards us. Dengue fever is called ""bone break disease"" because the pain is so agonizing it feels like your bones are being broken, and your joints are being crushed, and not even morphine does much for it , apparently. 

Here's another reason not to go: huge study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in February 2024 shows that every case of Covid drops  your IQ between 3 and 9 points.

This questions is more what public health does...after the detection, other surveillance tools are utilized.

"Adding on to your comment.

We really don't know where the positive wastewater sample really came from. Hell, it could be from pasteurized milk getting poured down a drain since that also can have fragments of inactivated virus.

This is also worth highlighting from the article.

Even in the worst case of the H5N1 particles found in early May being from a human infection (which is a big assumption), the evidence suggests that it didn't spread to anyone else.",2024-06-03 19:51:20,SanFrancisco

"As a frequent visitor of the Safari Park, I will say that the tours are worth it and depends on what you want to see. The one that‚Äôs always on top of my list to do when possible is the deluxe caravan Safari aka the deluxe wildlife Safari. This takes you into the multi-acre field exhibits, each broken into geographical zones. The deluxe wildlife Safari is 90 minutes along, typically will take you into East Africa and Asian savanna. You‚Äôll see white rhinos, several Antelope species ,giraffes, crowned cranes, wildebeests, and Cape buffalos in East Africa. In the Asian Savanna, you‚Äôll have Indian rhinos, banteng which are wild cattle, a few different deer species, Nilgai, and Blackbuck which are Indian antelope species that I love. 

I truly love that Safari tour the most and I appreciate the multi-species approach as it allows for animals to have interactions with one another in their native range. 

As for other paid Safaris, the BTS tours are a solid choice as well. I‚Äôve done tours for elephants, rhinos, and Walkabout Australia. All were fun and very informative tours. They recently combined the rhinos and elephants tour into 1 so perhaps that would be a fun one to do, I plan to do it as soon as I have extra money üò≠

As for what you can do without paying extra, there‚Äôs quite a bit and you can easily kill a few hours walking around. The exhibits I think are stellar in regards to design and animals features definitely are Lion Camp, Tiger Trail, Walkabout Australia, and Condor Ridge. Lion Camp is almost 20 years old but still regarded as one of the most impeccable lion habitats in the country. Tiger Trail is very immersive, making use of its landscape and foliage to replicate an Southeast Asian jungle for both their tigers and visitors. Walkabout Australia houses the only 2 platypuses outside their native range but can be a bit hard to spot due to the lighting, there is a marsupial walking area where kangaroos and wallabies can literally walk(or hop) in front of you. And Condor Ridge showcases the work done by the Safari Park regarding local species, with the highlight being of course the California Condors. 

2 of my other favorite areas are Elephant Valley and African Forest. Elephant Valley is home to 8 elephants and will soon be getting an upgrade, making is more immersive for guests and adding onto the existing area to increase their habitat as well as introducing species like waterfowl. African Forest is a criminally underrated area that is so quaint but not without its charm. It‚Äôs filled with endangered birds and antelope species, very scenic but you can enjoy some quiet time from the busy crowds when you need it :) Some birds may be off exhibit due to Avian Influenza so you may see signage about it around the park.

"Inflation costs aren't evenly distributed. Some sectors - like clothing - have seen very little inflation. Food is a sector that's seen above-average inflation. Eggs, for example, are up ~300% since January 2022. It's not just perceived cost - these are real costs incurred in the production and distribution chain. Another huge factor is the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) that started last year and has killed over 44 million hens.

HPAI is affecting all poultry prices, which is putting demand pressure on all meat prices. (It's also the reason that every aviary at the zoo has sanitizing pads at the entrance and why the flamingos and penguins are off exhibit).

Airport food costs more because airport rent is 2-3x more than comparable commercial rent, suppliers charge more to deliver to airports, and because employment costs are higher. If these places were just raking in cash, they'd never go out of business - but they do, often.",2023-01-11 13:06:25,SanDiego

&gt; The Orange County announcement comes less than a week after Los Angeles County‚Äôs first avian flu cases of the year [were reported](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-18/bird-flu-los-angeles-county-first-case-avian-flu) as birds migrate south for winter amid a global wave of the deadly virus, known as H5N1.
&gt; 
&gt; Public health officials warn that while avian flu is not typically a threat to humans, people should take steps to avoid infection and help stop the spread of the virus.
&gt; 
&gt; The state Department of Fish and Wildlife advised hunters in particular to take action to limit their potential exposure to the virus, which has wreaked havoc among avian populations this year.
&gt; 
&gt; In the U.S., nearly 48 million birds in 43 states have died this year as avian influenza has proliferated across the country, [according to](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-commercial-backyard-flocks) the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Experts have said that number is likely a significant undercount, because many bird flu deaths are not detected or reported.
&gt; 
&gt; Poultry farms have euthanized entire flocks of chickens and turkeys this year in response to the threat, and thousands of wild birds have been killed by the virus across the U.S. As fall migration gets underway, [experts say](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-03/infectious-bird-flu-spreads-california-chickens-wild-birds) an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù wave of death among domestic and wild bird populations is spreading south, including to Southern California.
&gt; 
&gt; Health authorities urge Californians who encounter sick or dead birds to file a report with the California Department of Public Health‚Äôs dedicated web portal [at this link](https://westnile.ca.gov/report).",2022-10-24 18:58:58,OrangeCounty

Wild birds are often asymptomatic and are capable of spreading it through migration. Essentially meaning that as bad as things are right now, spring migration patterns are about to make things much worse. 
As worried as I am for all the birds, it‚Äôs very scary to think about H5N1 mutating and becoming a human to human respiratory illness. The more it spreads, the more opportunities for mutation.

It's interesting to note that this only affected egg prices.  Over 50 million birds were destroyed due to the Avian flu.  But this mostly affected layer chickens responsible for egg production.

[Chicken meat prices are still up compared to 2021.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/why-egg-prices-are-surging-but-chicken-prices-are-falling.html) It's because broiler chickens have a lifecycle of 5-9 weeks, whereas layer chickens need at least 20 weeks to reach full productivity.

"You really dont understand chemistry and the refining process do you.... Gasoline and Diesel are made from the same general product, Crude Oil. Gasoline and Diesel are made at different temperatures, have different chemical compositions as well as different specific gravities. There are 2 distinct methods to make Gasoline and Diesel, they are just made with the same natural product, Crude Oil.

The reason Diesel prices are higher than gas prices is because (partially) due to demand. Gasoline is used more in the US versus Diesel. Therefore, Oil/Gas companies make less Diesel than Gasoline and therefore prices go slightly higher as there is less supply.

You also dont understand how supply and demand work. There is a limited amount of supply of Natural Gas (not a derivative of Crude Oil, this is something different). The local Gas company has to buy this from Oil/Gas companies who are charging this higher rate. The local gas company is then delivering these increases to us. To be fair, the local Gas Companies were very transparent in the fact that temporary price increases were coming.

The same thing is currently happening with Eggs. Supply is significantly down due to Avian Flu. So prices go up. It sucks but nothing we can do about it....

&amp;#x200B;

While there may be some price gouging, specifically by the oil companies, Supply is way down. And that is always going to cause price increases. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do. The government back in the day decided to make utilities privatized and the consumers have been suffering for years because of this. If utilities were still run by the government, we definitely wouldnt be seeing this stuff occuring, but who knows what other problems may have come because of that (i.e. slow response times, corrupton, etc.)

"&gt;Any trip to the grocery store does not fit the narrative that inflation has gone down. You name it; everything has doubled or tripled in cost. Eggs, if you can find them, have tripled in price; chicken and meat, the same. If inflation has come down, no evidence of it has appeared on the West Coast.

Inflation going down doesn't mean prices will go down.  That would require deflation, which can be even worse than inflation.  Inflation going down just means the rate of the price increases is falling, thus prices are still increasing, just at, you know, a slower rate.  Also, it's not like everything in the economy happens at instant speed.  The price adjustments have to work their way through the entire economy.  While prices are stabilizing for some things, other things are still catching up to the current inflated prices.  Finally, local factors can alter the prices of commodities in a particular locale.  For instance, egg prices are high because an outbreak of bird flu is causing us to cull egg-laying hen populations, so our egg prices are going to be higher for until the egg-laying hen population returns to normal levels, increasing egg supplies.  I would suspect the price of chicken would be increasing for the same reasons.",2023-02-16 20:15:32,SantaBarbara

"Aldi doesn‚Äôt overstock items that rot, it‚Äôs part of how they keep prices reasonable. A large grocery store might have twice as much produce or dairy but not all of its going to sell. To make an argument against Aldi just on eggs is being ignorant of the other discounts that have made me a regular at the bixbK location. There‚Äôs been a National egg shortage for a year due to the eradication of multiple states worth of poultry to stop a avian flu nightmare. 

Their Millville brand is actually General Mills, so a two boxes of Cinnamon Toast Crunch will be next to each other on shelf but one is Millville and is a few dollars cheaper. 
The factory that make GirlScoutCookies has year round versions that are shaped different but taste same for $1.85.  
The Aldi Finds are great because you‚Äôll stumble of something you never thought about, example: Thanksgiving Flavored Potato Chips by Clancy. OMG! For $1.99 before thanksgiving and then $.79 the week after these herby Stuffing Flavor etc didn‚Äôt last long, I hope they return. 
Finally, I really appreciate that Aldi has tried to do something about shopping carts. The simple quarter in to use and quarter returned afterwards has made their parking tidier, and the staff will let you fill your own bags as you shop which helps you figure out how much haul I can handle.",2023-05-06 16:35:30,LongBeach

Nice downvotes, cowards. Or click that downvote button some more and feel that dopamine rush. Go on, if I am so wrong with my opinion, respond instead of being cowards. I know most of you will not because you don't really care about seeking the truth of the world. You instead do not question it and assume your reality is 100% correctly assumed. Nice assumption. You have been fooled by satan. Smoke some more weed and see how much love you feel. The path of righteousness is straight. https://youtu.be/1Cj2SPyqELU

Do not take mrna technology that is obviously lacking long term clinical trials. The first long term trials are set to end in November 2023. Meanwhile mortality rates are up, covid cases are up, and cancer rates are up 800% (no, I am not exaggerating). Nice. Just wait until bird flu! Because that is coming. And will have a 10-50% mortality rate. As per the head of the CDC's recent public warnings about bird flu. All of the UK's chickens are indoors now in order to avoid it. Google it.

I literally give no fucks if this comment means no weed. Weed can go to hell. I never ever want to smoke again.

"I want to point out that monkeypox, Covid 19, HIV, Mad Cow Disease, SARS, Ebola, Bird Flu, Swine Flu- all of them humans first contracted by eating meat.  So if people didn't eat meat, we likely never would have suffered from the above illnesses.

That is a lot of death and human suffering that could have been prevented had people just not eaten meat in the first place.  Meat isn't even something you need to eat to survive!  

On top of that, eating meat is one of, if not the leading cause, of greenhouse gas emissions, which is fueling the climate crisis we are experiencing.

Additionally, farm animals receive antibiotics very regularly which is a major cause of antibiotic resistance.  That is another unfortunate way that the meat industry is impacting human health.",2022-07-31 11:10:23,SantaCruz

"**[Human mortality from H5N1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mortality_from_H5N1)** 
 
 &gt;Human mortality from H5N1 or the human fatality ratio from H5N1 or the case-fatality rate of H5N1 refer to the ratio of the number of confirmed human deaths resulting from confirmed cases of transmission and infection of H5N1 to the number of those confirmed cases. For example, if there are 100 confirmed cases of humans infected with H5N1 and 10 die, then there is a 10% human fatality ratio (or mortality rate). H5N1 flu is a concern due to the global spread of H5N1 that constitutes a pandemic threat. The majority of H5N1 flu cases have been reported in southeast and east Asia.
