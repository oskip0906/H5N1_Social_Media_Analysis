If so, we're way too scared of shit. The bird flu isn't passable to humans, so non-fertilized eggs are just not an issue. I could see the egg supply dropping over weeks, but not days.

"Totally. I'm sure the daycare is paying more for diapers, toilet paper, electricity, natural gas, and everything else they use. No different from all of us at home. Sadly, they have to pass those costs along.

I suppose their other option is cutting back on some of those things but my guess is most parents wouldn't like that. 

From June 2021 to June 2022, natural gas prices increased 165.5% across the US. ""We don't want to raise your daycare rates, but to save costs we're turning the thermostat down this winter and encourage you to dress your kids warm. We'll no longer be serving hot food.""

Most all of our own workplaces are doing the same. Businesses generally try to absorb some of it (I know my own company has) but at some point you do have to pass along at least some of that to the customers. I don't know of anyone who has had their boss come to them and say, ""We're paying more for all the resources we use, but we don't wanna pass that to the customer so we need to cut your pay by 10% in order to keep from having to impact customers.""

Much of it is likely because we don't always understand the reason behind the increases. When they're explained, most are accepting of it. I know with my own customers, they've been very understanding in that we've laid out how we've shouldered some of the cost increases to our own business but have had to pass along some of it (less than our competitors have passed along). At the same time, it's not as if you're going to walk into the grocery store and they'd have a sign explaining that eggs have gone up 49% in 2022 largely due to bird flu killing millions of chickens and farmers entering into price agreements for product they couldn't fulfill.",2023-01-04 07:06:56,minnesota

"From CNBC article: 

""It may seem counterintuitive that egg and chicken prices moved in opposite directions.
The dynamic is primarily due to a severe outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. — which has killed many egg-laying hens but has largely left chickens raised for meat production unscathed, according to economists.

Chickens raised for meat consumption — known as ""broilers"" — aren't affected by avian flu to the same extent as the ""layers.""
""It's two totally different styles of production, two totally different breeds of bird,"" Moscogiuri said.
The life cycle of a broiler is much shorter — anywhere from 5.5 to 9 weeks, from hatch to slaughter, according to Vencomatic Group, a poultry consulting firm.

However, the life cycle for an egg-laying hen can be upwards of 100 weeks, Moscogiuri said. It can take about five to six months for layers just to reach full productivity, according to the Agriculture Department.
The latter are therefore more susceptible to bird flu since farmers must keep them alive for a longer time, experts said.
Broiler quantity is also up, contributing to lower chicken prices at the grocery store.""",2023-04-04 19:10:33,minnesota

"&gt;Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed in two poultry flocks in Minnesota, the state Board of Animal Health announced Saturday.

&gt;The agency said the affected poultry flocks are a commercial flock of nearly 300,000 turkeys in Meeker County, and a backyard flock of 17 chickens, ducks and geese in Mower County. Samples collected from both flocks were tested on March 25 and confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

&gt;The state Board of Animal Health said they're the first confirmed cases in Minnesota in 2022.

&gt;Back in 2015, 9 million birds in Minnesota were killed by the virus, or euthanized to slow its spread. The virus is believed to be spread by migrating waterfowl in the spring.

&gt;Poultry producers in the state had been on high alert for weeks, and taking steps to increase biosecurity, after the virus was detected in neighboring states, including Iowa and South Dakota.

&gt;Officials cautioned that the appearance of avian flu in a backyard flock is a key difference from the 2015 outbreak.

&gt;""We are prepared to make sure this outbreak stays small,” said Dr. Jill Nezworski, a poultry veterinarian and a board member of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. “And I want to remind all poultry owners that biosecurity takes 100 percent commitment, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.""

"&gt;According to USDA Agricultural Marketing Service data, the average per-pound feature price for whole frozen turkeys was $1.11 the week of Nov. 3-9 and 95 cents the week of Nov. 10-16, a decline of 14% in just one week; and the share of stores offering feature prices rose from 29% to 60%. This means consumers who have not yet purchased a turkey should be able to find one at a lower cost than the Farm Bureau average.

Seems that's likely the data used in the infographic. They shopped prices before stores started the steep discounting. The reality is that most stores are losing money on the turkey this week, while hoping to make it up by selling you all the fixings. For instance, that $1.99 box of Stove Top Stuffing at Cub, on sale right now, is frequently on sale for 99¢ at other times throughout the year, so even on sale now they're making a nice cut there.

Average Thanksgiving meal costs are up 20% but it still doesn't seem that crazy. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual Thanksgiving dinner cost survey, the average cost is $64.05 this year to feed 10 people. That's just over $1 more per person. With fuel prices what they are, seems that driving to another store would negate some of that savings. More so, the time and energy wouldn't be worth it for many.

Supply and demand is a myth. We live in a world where prices are dictated by corporations based upon what they determine the market will endure. Supply is irrelevant. Demand is irrelevant. When the war in Ukraine started gas prices skyrocketed, reality was that the US doesn't use Russian oil, the US supply wasn't impacted. The only thing that happened was that the gas companies said the market would tolerate a price increase, so they took it.

As I understand it, the 59 million number applies to *all* chickens across the US, which is the 9 billion number. I can't find any source saying the *overall* US chicken population was decimated by 20% last year.

And to tie this back to the OP's original post about Kwik Trip chicken tender prices, aren't we talking about the price of broilers anyways?

I think this is another example of how statistics can be used to distort an industry agenda.

"1. We're not ignoring the 9 billion broiler number, that was your number, that we now know is irrelevant because the avian flu mostly affected egg layers.  
2. Even if the chickens that were culled/died were broilers - *you still have to immediately redirect 60 million eggs to the hatcheries to replace them.* That affects the prices of chickens and eggs.  60 million food chickens is equal to the American intake of 2 days worth.  That might not seem like much, but remove 2 days worth of oil from the market and see what that does to gas prices. 
3. The Time Magazine sources were *almost entirely from Farm Action and/or it's representatives, a biased anti-corporate action group who are making a claim based on their own analysis of one company's SEC filing.*   The only other sources in the article are the SEC filing itself, and one academic's quote that has nothing to do with the claim in the article. 
4. Farm Action's single argument seems to be that Cal Foods (and by extension the entire industry) was gouging because they earned too much money.
5. The question then becomes, how much is too much? Again this is basic math.  If an egg cost 5cents to make and ship, and I told it for 15cents, then I make ten cent profit.  If now my production cost is still 5 cents but the market is buying at 40 cents, I'm now making a 26 cents (or 500%) profit.  Is that too much?  Why would they be obligated to sell below market value?
6. It doesn't mean the entire industry made this level of profits, in fact they probably didn't.  Cal Foods wasn't affected by the flu, so the increase in the value of their product was a windfall. There were other companies that saw essentially their entire flock get culled and had to rebuild from zero. 
7. Honestly, Cub foods probably gouged more than they did, because Kwik Trip sold eggs for $3/doz while Cub sold for $5/doz.  I've always found Cub Foods to be the most predatory food retailer in the area.",2023-10-24 01:33:14,minnesota

"Here’s the full post from the Raptor Center:

On April 12th and 13th, The Raptor Center responded to reports of three great horned owl nest mates in distress from a nest in Lake Nokomis Park in Minneapolis. On admission to our triage hospital building, all three were suffering from extreme neurological signs and one suddenly died. Due to a high level of suffering, the remaining two youngsters were humanely euthanized and all three tested for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). Today, not only did we receive notice that the young owl samples tested positive, but we also responded to calls about two deceased adult great horned owls in the same area, presumed to be the parents. We highly suspect that their samples will be positive too. 

We are heartbroken at The Raptor Center to see the presumed loss of an entire great horned owl family due to HPAI and unfortunately this is not the first one we have responded to during this outbreak. Nearly every day we are admitting patients that come in suffering from the severe symptoms of HPAI.

Minnesota is experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of HPAI in wild bird populations and unfortunately 90-100% of raptors who are infected will die from the disease. The Raptor Center is doing everything possible to continue to safely receive, triage, and treat birds in need during this difficult time and our team deeply appreciates all the help and the support from the community while we do so. 

If you find a raptor in need please call us at 612-624-4745 or visit our website at raptor.umn.edu

The Raptor Center's blurb on it

&gt;The United States is unfortunately experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in our wild birds. It is important to remember that all bird species are susceptible to HPAI- but how they show or do not show signs of illness and the role they play in carrying and spreading the disease will vary. This virus is shed in the feces and respiratory secretions of infected birds and is very hardy, with virus particles able to survive for weeks in cool, damp environments. In wildlife, we know the most about how this virus works and presents in waterfowl, shorebirds, seabirds- as these are the groups of birds who are most likely to carry and shed the virus without showing signs of illness. We know some about how this virus impacts groups of birds like raptors, as these birds often get severely sick and rapidly die from the virus. Unfortunately, we have a lot of gaps in knowledge about the role of songbirds in HPAI outbreaks. We have some data from previous outbreaks around the world, but this outbreak is very different. The 2022 outbreak is unique because of the very high levels of transmission of the currently circulating H5N1 virus strain in wildlife. With minimal viral surveillance being done with songbirds, it is hard to measure the risk of transmission from songbirds to other birds. Every day at The Raptor Center, we are seeing the impact of HPAI- as we triage and test birds like bald eagles and great horned owls that are intensely suffering from fatal neurological illness due to HPAI. With these infected birds, humane euthanasia is the only tool we have left to help them. We also know that this strain and outbreak is causing severe illness in other species  like geese, ducks, blue jays, and crows.

"I do care, but I've gotta eat. This form of euthanasia is actually permitted under the USDA emergency declaration to help slow the spread of avian flu. Desperate times kind of situation. The entire agricultural industry is pretty shitty. Farms abuse migrant workers, dump tons of shitty chemicals into our soil/water, are responsible for over 10% of greenhouse gasses ommitted every year (in the US), etc. If the average person took a real stand against every atrocity committed by modern agricultural, they'd starve to death. You may not care, but that doesn't mean these things aren't equally as terrible as killing chickens.",2022-04-24 22:08:53,Minneapolis
"Good to know, although you might want to hold off putting the feeder out until the avian flu calms down a bit",2022-04-25 06:52:36,Minneapolis
You obviously didn’t read the discussion in this thread about the inhumane methods being used to kill chickens infected with avian flu.,2022-04-25 08:16:43,Minneapolis

Doesn’t avian flu infect hummingbirds?,2022-05-11 09:11:48,Minneapolis
None of these places are accepting birds due to the avian flu…in all of Minnesota. I know this because I just rescued a baby duckling myself. We found an independent farm that was willing to take in the baby. Hopefully restrictions get lifted soon! Message me if you wanna chat and I can give some pointers :) thanks for saving the little one! I learned ducklings are legit the sweetest animals of all time,2022-06-19 11:16:15,Minneapolis
"I've volunteered in the avian nursery at The Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Roseville. Fantastic place and workers there. They only euthanize if it has symptoms of avian flu or if it's suffering badly. I'd take it to them, and THEY will know what to do. They rehabilitate many different kinds of birds and release them!",2022-06-30 06:05:55,Minneapolis
"Ohhh, that would make sense; I've seen some wheat products jump, too.

When chicken and eggs went up a few months back, i was at least aware of the avian flu outbreak.",2022-08-07 21:52:51,Minneapolis
"Call the [Wildlife Rehabilitation Center](https://wrcmn.org/). They might be able to take it...I know they stopped taking in birds for awhile because of avian flu, but they may have resumed doing bird rehab.",2022-08-17 22:39:04,Minneapolis
Second that.  Especially with avian flu going around...,2023-02-03 11:14:04,Minneapolis
I know a lot of birds of prey fell victim to the avian flu last year and there are lots more small rodents as a result.,2023-03-12 07:14:52,Minneapolis
Seward Co-op always has a good selection of locally sourced eggs (from our neighbors in Wisconsin if I recall). Pricing has been pretty stable despite all the egg-flation / avian flu supply issues that are out there.,2023-03-23 00:37:37,Minneapolis
"I've been told that a couple years ago the Avian Flu [wiped out a \*lot\* of raptors](https://raptor.umn.edu/about-us/our-research/HPAI) in Minnesota.  The survivors are recovering the population, but its still down from a few years ago.

So I'm sure the verdant spring helped, but it also sounds like there aren't as many hawks and owls to keep the bunnies in check.",2024-07-09 03:05:46,Minneapolis
"“protests were in response to an investigation into a ""recent mass killing of 5.3 million chickens following an outbreak of 'highly pathogenic avian influenza.' “

Did the farm do this or the USDA? My wife is a chicken farmer and if your flock has even one bird with avian influenza the government will depopulate your entire flock with zero input from you.,2022-04-24 22:58:23,Minneapolis
"This interrupts the enjoyment of the mass.  If I don't care about his chicken farm and saving lives by killing birds infected with avian influenza,  why should I have to have my enjoyment interrupted?",2022-04-25 04:57:14,Minneapolis
Are they sick? Avian influenza is a big problem with now. It's really not that hot out right now so I wouldn't be too concerned if they're out there for a few hours. I'd bet they're being haphazardly quarantined.,2022-05-24 03:43:16,Minneapolis
"You are generally correct. The situation with ducklings (as well as goslings, pelicans, and raptors) is currently an exception due to the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).",2022-06-20 08:39:18,Minneapolis

"I am in Carlton County, although I don't hunt, I have not seen the amount of turkeys I usually see.  Usually I see 10-15  per day and may see that in a week now. Not sure if it's the weather or maybe the Avian flu.",2022-04-24 23:19:10,Duluth
