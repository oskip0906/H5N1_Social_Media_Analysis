State animal health officials have quarantined the property in southern Wisconsin's Jefferson County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Milwaukee. All chickens in the flock will be destroyed and will not enter the food system, the USDA said.

Farms that raise turkeys and chickens for consumption have been on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity since avian influenza was recently discovered in a handful of states, including Indiana and Iowa. **Producers fear a repeat of a widespread bird flu outbreak in 2015 that killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly $1 billion**.

Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can spread from flock to flock by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.",2022-03-14 19:04:44,madisonwi

This hardware cloth (steel) is buried about 1 foot into the ground around the run to discourage animals from digging under the fence/ This means wild birds cannot get in and share space / food with the chickens which greatly reduces risk of avian flu transmission.

"Well, because mosquitos are a very important part of the overall ecosystem. 

Mosquitos, and other biting insects, including bedbugs, Black Flies and fleas (among others), is how Nature takes energy from the top of the food change and sends it back down to the bottom. Upthread, folks were celebrating frogs, toads and dragonflies for their Mosquito-eating prowess. Guess what happens to those happy warriors when there are no more mosquitos? 

There are fewer frogs, toads, dragonflies, damselflies, salamanders, spiders and a host of other useful critters. And fewer of the critters that eat those useful critters (spiders get a double whammy here). 

Which will throw things quite out of whack. Other species that aren't mosquitos, which hatch in big bunches during specific parts of the year, will benefit greatly, because their predators, deprived of a regular diet of reliable mosquitos, will be few and far between. Their population will boom! Friendly critters like ticks, earwigs, crickets and others. 

Also, the bigger critters that eat frogs, toads, dragonflies, damselflies, salamanders, spiders and the host of other mosquito predators will also suffer. Fish, birds, snakes, and other forest dwellers. 

I approve of trying to reduce populations of disease-causing mosquitos. And also use Skeeter Dunks in standing water around my house. I further approve of efforts to eliminate invasive species of mosquitoes that are devastating rare bird species in Hawaii by spreading Avian Flu. 

But, overall, the little bastards are an important part of the natural balance. So I guess I'll resign myself to keep swatting the ones who are trying to suck my personal energy back down the foodchain, and think about the Circle of Life.",2024-06-15 22:44:25,madisonwi

The DNR is not recommending removal of bird feeders, unless it’s attracting geese and ducks. False information like this could result in starvation of early migrators that depend on human supplied food. Hummingbirds are much more likely to die from inappropriately cleaned feeders and starvation than coming into contact with seabirds, which I highly doubt are eating from hummingbird feeders.",2022-04-24 22:28:25,milwaukee

They should be able to help- I took a bird with broken leg there last week and other people were bringing birds in- they’re just screening to see if the bird seems like it has symptoms of avian flu before taking them.,2023-07-15 17:19:39,milwaukee
My grandpa said they weren’t there because of the avian flu that was going through the bird population. Hopefully will be back this year!,2023-08-07 09:54:28,milwaukee
"And especially since the inflation was mostly caused by higher corporate profits, high oil and wheat prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the avian flu causing poultry and egg prices to rise.

"The 2021-2022 round of inflation was caused by:

* [Corporations increasing their prices greater than their costs increased](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-05-10/column-these-are-the-companies-whose-thirst-for-profits-drove-inflation-higher), generating more profits for themselves

* Increasing wheat prices pulled the prices of other grains that could be feed substitutes higher
* Avian flu caused the price of poultry and eggs to go up, increasing inflation.  Prices of other protein sources were pulled up as a secondary effect.",2023-08-11 20:32:09,milwaukee
"I know that.  I'm saying if it was a thing that was hurriedly added on for a week or three because food prices skyrocketed and then was eliminated again - like if avian flu made egg prices skyrocket at a breakfast-only place or something, where everything's impacted.  I understand that's \_not\_ how it's being used most of the time.

To me, fees are only \_possibly\_ legit if they're temporary or I can somehow avoid them.  If they're mandatory and/or permanent, just build them into the price and be done.",2023-08-15 12:49:31,milwaukee
The article is specifically about avian flu. Birdfeeders were also discouraged during that outbreak. Putting out clean water for birds and wildlife has generally not been discouraged among wildlife scientists. Source: I am a wildlife biologist.,2024-01-18 14:25:02,milwaukee
unfortunately a lot of places aren’t taking birds right now because of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza),2023-08-07 21:52:50,milwaukee
