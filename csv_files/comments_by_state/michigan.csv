"This is something that I've been keeping close tabs on because we raise our own ducks and geese.

This particular strain has been going through bird flocks from Asia to Europe and now to the US and North America like wildfire. Waterfowl apparently don't show any symptoms, just mysteriously die. Dryland birds like chickens and turkeys show symptoms but die quickly, and the entire flock gets very sick very fast and often dies off within days. It is only jumped to a couple of people, and they were ones who worked closely with sick animals in not so clean conditions. The odds of this bird flu jumping to humans at this point, I think, is pretty low given that it has been spreading around the world with migrating birds and affected many small flocks and commercial flocks as well. A whole lot of humans have been exposed with no sickness. It also does not seem to be jumping to other mammals.

The infected flock in Michigan is a homestead flock not far from me, and there are a lot of us in Southwest Michigan who have small flocks. We are keeping our birds inside their duck yard when we have been allowing them to free-range. They are recommending that people keep their birds either inside a coop that cannot be infiltrated by wild birds or do what they can to keep food and water away from wild birds and follow serious biohazard protocols. Gloves only for the barn, boots only used in the barn, stuff like that.

the birds are smart enough to find food elsewhere. wouldn't you feel bad if the birds who ate from your feeder died from bird flu?,2022-04-20 15:56:17,michigan
"Feels mean, but yes.  Feeders are potentially worse than deer baiting in terms of spreading respiratory illnesses.  Birds aren't limited by geography nearly as much as deer, so the couple robin that stop off at a feeder could easily cover a few miles in the air to reach a local chicken or turkey farm that has huge amounts of food littering the floors to either catch or spread whatever version is floating around right now.  Then it runs through the livestock like wildfire and the entire flock gets culled.  

It's basically forcing social distancing for birds when possible to avoid that, plus the inevitable crossover to humans since bird flu won't just stay in the birds.",2022-04-20 16:51:20,michigan

"FWIW, as someone who follows this for work, it's not sudden. 

This round of bird flu has been ongoing since early 2022, and it pops up again when the migrations start, so early spring-late spring and early fall-late fall. 

There are a few different pathways (Pacific, Central, Mississippi, Atlantic) birds tend to follow, though it'll obviously differ based on specific species. 

It gets reported more in states with more producers, as would be expected. 

The last BIG outbreak before this one was in 2014-2015 and kind of died off. This one has been basically ongoing and just flares back up with migration. The wiki article has more specifics in the history section. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza

Source for someone contracting bird flu from drinking raw milk?,2024-05-24 12:37:11,michigan
"I don’t have a source for anyone getting sick with bird flu because it hasn’t happened (yet). However, there have been 2 cases in Michigan of dairy farmers catching bird flu (I think both were dairy farmers but I know at least one was for sure) from their cows. Those cows pass the virus into their milk and it can very easily infect a human. It doesn’t sound like a case of “if” but more like “when”. The more these people keep drinking infected milk, the more likely bird flu will mutate like covid did to jump from human to human. 

To the point I was making about them getting sick, they are already making themselves sick on raw milk by drinking those pathogens. The reason raw milk was banned in the US to begin with was because it accounted for a quarter of all food borne illnesses in the US.",2024-05-24 12:55:05,michigan
