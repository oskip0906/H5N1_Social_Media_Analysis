"The Brookings Institute has a nice summary [here](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-caused-the-u-s-pandemic-era-inflation/). 

Biden’s unprecedented pandemic era money giveaways were a major driver resulting in increased labor costs. Forget about the multiple billions that were stolen with few meaningful prosecutions. That barely reached the public consciousness. When you expand the money supply so dramatically this is a predictable result. 

Supply chain issues resulting from Covid and rising fuel costs also factor in. Bird flu in the poultry industry and other unique circumstances add to the phenomena for example. 

I’m also certain manufactures can slip in price increases virtually unnoticed under the cover of so many others sectors doing the same. So greed in the pursuit of padding hr bottom line plays a part. 

Industry consolidation over the last few decades is also coming home to roost. Less competition drives up prices.",2023-07-24 10:08:18,Maryland
"Insurance is a function of ""whatever this repairs/replaces"". So if your used car is worth $14,000 when you got it and your insurance was $800,then the insurance is pegged off the current cost of that value.  That value, in a non-inflating market means your car depreciates and your insurance stays about the same.

In an inflationary market, the same car now costs $16,000 so your insurance as to match THAT cost.  

Cost of parts is high.

The three drivers to this, are not presidential, so dont blame Trump or Biden...

-The cost of fuel struck first and that has since been stabilized...but that impacted truckers and the supply chain all over...

-The cost of raw goods increased (eggs, milk, meats, wheat...each for different reasons, like Ukraine war destabilized wheat prices...Eggs increased because of multiple successive bird flu epidemics during covid that didnt even make the news...etc...

-Companies overcompensating for inflation which in turn doubled the increase...they are now getting pressure from you and I not willing to pay stupid prices for things...so as people stop buying at high prices, they have to lower prices",2024-06-15 15:18:03,Maryland

Birds were closed because of the avian flu. They are all back open except you cant go into the two aviaries. DC Zoo is awesome but its much more of a hassle to go there than Baltimore.,2022-09-05 19:14:49,Maryland
"The Maryland Zoo is pretty meh in terms of zoos. It’s not terrible. But if there’s an avian flu thing going around, and you can’t see the penguins, it’s not worth going. Especially now that they got rid of the polar bears. The penguins are really the only attraction. So damn cute!",2022-12-11 10:24:58,Maryland
"Well said, and I'd only add to your well written rebuttal that we're seeing cartel-like behavior from the food and fuel sectors. There is no shortage of egg laying hens, the avian flu didn't permanently destroy the egg industry, so why are egg producers bragging about 800% profit increases to shareholders while gouging consumers? 

The ability to eat basic foodstuff and heat one's home are not ""lifestyle choices."" The person you replied to has a spectacularly condescending attitude towards the working poor, as if setting your thermostat to an appropriate temperature or eating a fried egg was akin to buying a Hermes bag with public assistance money. This contempt for working class people is vile.",2023-02-02 09:46:23,Maryland
Avian flu… or eating poisoned rats an/or mice?,2023-04-07 11:30:24,Maryland
Very odd. They tested positive for Avian flu and the article suggests they were transferring it because the vultures were eating other vultures carcasses. Vultures feeding on their own kind is pretty rare. They must have been absolutely starving.,2023-04-07 12:20:14,Maryland

"Complicated. Main force appears, paradoxically, to be hunting. Live decoys are/were used, eggs gathered and hatched to increase population. Someone here will know better. Combine that anthropic force with the other ones of greener lawns, less hunting, warming winters and if you want geese, that is how you get geese. Will be exciting when human-goose exposure leads to a bad avian influenza spillover.",2022-10-22 15:11:36,Maryland
"What taxes, specifically, are going up that you're referencing here?

Rates have food inflation have been decreasing substantially in their past year. A lot of said inflation is linked to labor shortages and supply chain issues (such as extreme weather wrecking crops and avian influenza leading to millions of chickens being culled). There's also been a great deal of corporate greed/price raising in the guise of inflation. 

What does our governor have to do with any of these factors affecting food prices?",2024-07-04 07:22:49,Maryland

"They might - but the same thing applies to Hogan here as it does for everything else - the things that he's good on are generally (to Marylanders) things where his party is out of touch.

Ultimately if H5N1 becomes a big thing Biden and Dems are probably toast anyway - the economic impact of another significant disease emergency just before the election would overrule any actual analysis of who did better handling COVID.

Geese are destroying the local ecosystem for other fowl. Because portions of them aren't migrating it is likely they'll start culling nests soon. They're also spreading bird flu.

We have antivrials for it already.

The CDC is meeting this month to go over the strains for this years flu vaccine and to talk H5N1. 

If you work with animals especially if ones known to be infected wear PPE and don't consume raw milk. 

If this spreads any further go get the vaccine that we have already tested, I am sure there will be a mix of traditional vaccines and mRNA ones as if this became a pandemic, we seem to be in a good position to kick this things ass if it ends up going anywhere.

Oh my goodness they were about 6$ a dz before the bird flu and feed prices went up. Of coarse they have more overhead than the little flock owner would have.

"You mean EG.5? There's going to be a new COVID variant every year. Get your shot, or shots, make sure to mask up especially around those vulnerable and public spaces, and things will be fine. That doesn't mean that the pandemic is still ongoing though, right? 

I'm not disputing the danger. But every new COVID variant is going to be ""extremely dangerous"" by the virtue of it being new, just like every new Bird Flu variant, every Rhinovirus variant, etc. You just need to exercise appropriate caution.

I'm not from this country originally, and I have suppressed TB, which is a bummer when it comes to COVID. If my TB reactivated, I would be hiding away at home so my friends and neighbors who probably never had a TB vaccine or experienced it would not get it. I'd mask up for a new COVID variant, or for the flu if I needed to go get groceries if I needed to go outside.

 I'd encourage others to do the same.",2023-10-01 09:37:38,Lawrence
I should also add that there has been an increase of bird flu infections that has now been found in cows. Some people have became infected while working with these animals.

"Actually, I think it's a good lesson for kids in being economical in a supply/demand situation. Go out and show them the prices at the stores and explain why the prices are high like that right now (avian flu took out a bunch of chickens).

"The top comment answered this really well, but the empty and unkept enclosures are likely any avian enclosure (due to bird flu), animals like zebras, ostriches, giraffes, flamingos, and others (still in winter viewing until temps steady out), or animals like red wolves (under medical observation until both were recently euthanized due to long term illness, one had a type of cancer and other had severe chronic kidney disease).

If you go again in June, more enclosures will be populated because animals will be in their summer viewing (the main viewing areas). There’s a large area sectioned off because they are building a lion enclosure, in the past 5 or so years they redid the bear enclosure so that’s why that one looks much nicer than some of the others. They are constantly trying to upgrade the enclosures to better suit the animals, but that requires consistent funding they don’t get because they’re a nonprofit. Their funding comes from admissions (that’s why it’s 14.50 per adult), gift shop purchases, and cafe/food purchases.

Also depending on what time you went, many of the animals may have been sleeping or in their dens/burrows. They do not force teh animals to be publicly visible at all times.   
Several others are being remodeled, there are several construction projects going on currently at that facility.   


Some animals, it is still a bit too cold out at nights to have placed them on their summer exhibits and are still in the winter viewing area.   


I went to the zoo the previous weekend and that's what I saw. If you want to see the zoo in full power mode, wait until they can put their avians back on display and until later in the summer when all animals can be placed out in their exhibits.
