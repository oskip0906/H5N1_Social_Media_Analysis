"Totally. I'm sure the daycare is paying more for diapers, toilet paper, electricity, natural gas, and everything else they use. No different from all of us at home. Sadly, they have to pass those costs along.

I suppose their other option is cutting back on some of those things but my guess is most parents wouldn't like that. 

From June 2021 to June 2022, natural gas prices increased 165.5% across the US. ""We don't want to raise your daycare rates, but to save costs we're turning the thermostat down this winter and encourage you to dress your kids warm. We'll no longer be serving hot food.""

Most all of our own workplaces are doing the same. Businesses generally try to absorb some of it (I know my own company has) but at some point you do have to pass along at least some of that to the customers. I don't know of anyone who has had their boss come to them and say, ""We're paying more for all the resources we use, but we don't wanna pass that to the customer so we need to cut your pay by 10% in order to keep from having to impact customers.""

Much of it is likely because we don't always understand the reason behind the increases. When they're explained, most are accepting of it. I know with my own customers, they've been very understanding in that we've laid out how we've shouldered some of the cost increases to our own business but have had to pass along some of it (less than our competitors have passed along). At the same time, it's not as if you're going to walk into the grocery store and they'd have a sign explaining that eggs have gone up 49% in 2022 largely due to bird flu killing millions of chickens and farmers entering into price agreements for product they couldn't fulfill.",2023-01-03 17:06:56,minnesota

"From CNBC article: 

""It may seem counterintuitive that egg and chicken prices moved in opposite directions.
The dynamic is primarily due to a severe outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. — which has killed many egg-laying hens but has largely left chickens raised for meat production unscathed, according to economists.

Chickens raised for meat consumption — known as ""broilers"" — aren't affected by avian flu to the same extent as the ""layers.""
""It's two totally different styles of production, two totally different breeds of bird,"" Moscogiuri said.
The life cycle of a broiler is much shorter — anywhere from 5.5 to 9 weeks, from hatch to slaughter, according to Vencomatic Group, a poultry consulting firm.

However, the life cycle for an egg-laying hen can be upwards of 100 weeks, Moscogiuri said. It can take about five to six months for layers just to reach full productivity, according to the Agriculture Department.
The latter are therefore more susceptible to bird flu since farmers must keep them alive for a longer time, experts said.
Broiler quantity is also up, contributing to lower chicken prices at the grocery store.""",2023-04-04 06:10:33,minnesota

"&gt;Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed in two poultry flocks in Minnesota, the state Board of Animal Health announced Saturday.

&gt;The agency said the affected poultry flocks are a commercial flock of nearly 300,000 turkeys in Meeker County, and a backyard flock of 17 chickens, ducks and geese in Mower County. Samples collected from both flocks were tested on March 25 and confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

&gt;The state Board of Animal Health said they're the first confirmed cases in Minnesota in 2022.

&gt;Back in 2015, 9 million birds in Minnesota were killed by the virus, or euthanized to slow its spread. The virus is believed to be spread by migrating waterfowl in the spring.

&gt;Poultry producers in the state had been on high alert for weeks, and taking steps to increase biosecurity, after the virus was detected in neighboring states, including Iowa and South Dakota.

&gt;Officials cautioned that the appearance of avian flu in a backyard flock is a key difference from the 2015 outbreak.

&gt;""We are prepared to make sure this outbreak stays small,” said Dr. Jill Nezworski, a poultry veterinarian and a board member of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. “And I want to remind all poultry owners that biosecurity takes 100 percent commitment, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.""

"&gt;According to USDA Agricultural Marketing Service data, the average per-pound feature price for whole frozen turkeys was $1.11 the week of Nov. 3-9 and 95 cents the week of Nov. 10-16, a decline of 14% in just one week; and the share of stores offering feature prices rose from 29% to 60%. This means consumers who have not yet purchased a turkey should be able to find one at a lower cost than the Farm Bureau average.

Seems that's likely the data used in the infographic. They shopped prices before stores started the steep discounting. The reality is that most stores are losing money on the turkey this week, while hoping to make it up by selling you all the fixings. For instance, that $1.99 box of Stove Top Stuffing at Cub, on sale right now, is frequently on sale for 99¢ at other times throughout the year, so even on sale now they're making a nice cut there.

Average Thanksgiving meal costs are up 20% but it still doesn't seem that crazy. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual Thanksgiving dinner cost survey, the average cost is $64.05 this year to feed 10 people. That's just over $1 more per person. With fuel prices what they are, seems that driving to another store would negate some of that savings. More so, the time and energy wouldn't be worth it for many.

Supply and demand is a myth. We live in a world where prices are dictated by corporations based upon what they determine the market will endure. Supply is irrelevant. Demand is irrelevant. When the war in Ukraine started gas prices skyrocketed, reality was that the US doesn't use Russian oil, the US supply wasn't impacted. The only thing that happened was that the gas companies said the market would tolerate a price increase, so they took it.

As I understand it, the 59 million number applies to *all* chickens across the US, which is the 9 billion number. I can't find any source saying the *overall* US chicken population was decimated by 20% last year.

And to tie this back to the OP's original post about Kwik Trip chicken tender prices, aren't we talking about the price of broilers anyways?

I think this is another example of how statistics can be used to distort an industry agenda.

"1. We're not ignoring the 9 billion broiler number, that was your number, that we now know is irrelevant because the avian flu mostly affected egg layers.  
2. Even if the chickens that were culled/died were broilers - *you still have to immediately redirect 60 million eggs to the hatcheries to replace them.* That affects the prices of chickens and eggs.  60 million food chickens is equal to the American intake of 2 days worth.  That might not seem like much, but remove 2 days worth of oil from the market and see what that does to gas prices. 
3. The Time Magazine sources were *almost entirely from Farm Action and/or it's representatives, a biased anti-corporate action group who are making a claim based on their own analysis of one company's SEC filing.*   The only other sources in the article are the SEC filing itself, and one academic's quote that has nothing to do with the claim in the article. 
4. Farm Action's single argument seems to be that Cal Foods (and by extension the entire industry) was gouging because they earned too much money.
5. The question then becomes, how much is too much? Again this is basic math.  If an egg cost 5cents to make and ship, and I told it for 15cents, then I make ten cent profit.  If now my production cost is still 5 cents but the market is buying at 40 cents, I'm now making a 26 cents (or 500%) profit.  Is that too much?  Why would they be obligated to sell below market value?
6. It doesn't mean the entire industry made this level of profits, in fact they probably didn't.  Cal Foods wasn't affected by the flu, so the increase in the value of their product was a windfall. There were other companies that saw essentially their entire flock get culled and had to rebuild from zero. 
7. Honestly, Cub foods probably gouged more than they did, because Kwik Trip sold eggs for $3/doz while Cub sold for $5/doz.  I've always found Cub Foods to be the most predatory food retailer in the area.",2023-10-23 12:33:14,minnesota

"Here’s the full post from the Raptor Center:

On April 12th and 13th, The Raptor Center responded to reports of three great horned owl nest mates in distress from a nest in Lake Nokomis Park in Minneapolis. On admission to our triage hospital building, all three were suffering from extreme neurological signs and one suddenly died. Due to a high level of suffering, the remaining two youngsters were humanely euthanized and all three tested for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). Today, not only did we receive notice that the young owl samples tested positive, but we also responded to calls about two deceased adult great horned owls in the same area, presumed to be the parents. We highly suspect that their samples will be positive too. 

We are heartbroken at The Raptor Center to see the presumed loss of an entire great horned owl family due to HPAI and unfortunately this is not the first one we have responded to during this outbreak. Nearly every day we are admitting patients that come in suffering from the severe symptoms of HPAI.

Minnesota is experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of HPAI in wild bird populations and unfortunately 90-100% of raptors who are infected will die from the disease. The Raptor Center is doing everything possible to continue to safely receive, triage, and treat birds in need during this difficult time and our team deeply appreciates all the help and the support from the community while we do so.

The Raptor Center's blurb on it

&gt;The United States is unfortunately experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in our wild birds. It is important to remember that all bird species are susceptible to HPAI- but how they show or do not show signs of illness and the role they play in carrying and spreading the disease will vary. This virus is shed in the feces and respiratory secretions of infected birds and is very hardy, with virus particles able to survive for weeks in cool, damp environments. In wildlife, we know the most about how this virus works and presents in waterfowl, shorebirds, seabirds- as these are the groups of birds who are most likely to carry and shed the virus without showing signs of illness. We know some about how this virus impacts groups of birds like raptors, as these birds often get severely sick and rapidly die from the virus. Unfortunately, we have a lot of gaps in knowledge about the role of songbirds in HPAI outbreaks. We have some data from previous outbreaks around the world, but this outbreak is very different. The 2022 outbreak is unique because of the very high levels of transmission of the currently circulating H5N1 virus strain in wildlife. With minimal viral surveillance being done with songbirds, it is hard to measure the risk of transmission from songbirds to other birds. Every day at The Raptor Center, we are seeing the impact of HPAI- as we triage and test birds like bald eagles and great horned owls that are intensely suffering from fatal neurological illness due to HPAI. With these infected birds, humane euthanasia is the only tool we have left to help them. We also know that this strain and outbreak is causing severe illness in other species  like geese, ducks, blue jays, and crows.

"We’re going to see a lot more mammalian deaths from Avian flu in wildlife as it continues to spread globally. Specifically among mammals which eat the carcasses of dead birds. Given that we’re seeing it on every continent at this point, and to a growing variety of mammals, it’s probably safe to say that’s going to continue happening. 

Now bobcats aren’t people. Sea lions aren’t people. Foxes aren’t people. Mink aren’t people. And so far transmission to humans is rare. However now is a good time for people to be taking extra caution around wildlife and poultry production. This isn’t just farming, but also hunting. Now would be an exceptionally poor time for hunting birds, especially for consumption, unless you have some way to test for avian flu in the bird prior to doing so. 

there’s no reason for serious concern at this point provided simple precautions are taken. However precautions are warranted. We know mammal to mammal transmission is possible, we’ve seen it in sea lions and mink. We know bird to human transmission is possible. As long as we’re cautious, hopefully we won’t see human to human. 

If we *do* see human to human, there isn’t necessarily any reason to panic, but again, exercising caution and adopting pandemic-like measures of masks in public, etc would offer a measure of personal protection and perhaps peace of mind.

"It kills the birds and jumps to pigs, then humans you know those times where a lot of people die from the flu. That's because bird flu jumps from pigs to humans and presents with antigens that the majority of the public do not have immunity to. You cook your meat, but novel flu strains will cook our population. And those nut jobs at the beginning of COVID saying the regular flu is deadlier than COVID we're right when we talk about bird flus that make the leap.

Also, they don't even have to make the leap directly. Influenza virus does this really cool thing in host tissues where they can recombine their genetic info with other strains of flu in those hosts so even if the bird flu strain does not make the jump, the proteins that make it scary can.

But the largest concern is that it kills birds. If birds die you.cant fucking cook them and eat them. As such, poultry producers are required to kill flocks that even a single bird tests positive in. That can be millions of birds in a flock. That means millions in losses for the company and, well. No chicken on the store shelves.

I'd be 1000x less worried about this if a general influenza vaccine saw wide adoption.

Also carbon monoxide is very humane. The birds just go to sleep. They don't suffer. 

The have to burn the chickens after death to stop the spread. They virus can be spread from dead chickens. If another bird ate a carcus that had the flu, they could get the virus then pass it on to other birds. It's not just a chicken virus. It's effecting geese, ducks, pheasant etc. 

Also the difference between 2015 and now is that the virus started as highly pathogenic where as 2015 it started as low and moved to high during transmission. So the virus is very much worse now than before. This is probably why they suggested other jobs to workers. Trying to repopulate barns is difficult. You can't merge 2 flocks for fear one could have the virus. There's more biosecurity measures involved now. And trying to get pullets that are ready are expensive and take time. Sometimes months or even up to a year.

They also could have suggested other jobs if Rembrandt is remodeling barns. Egg facilities have to go to cage free systems. So if they decided they are going to remodel during the bird flu epidemic, they don't need laborers to manage birds.

Historically the smaller family farms were naturally more humane and more environmentally friendly, not in a hardcore environmentalist kind of way, but their operations were just naturally less destructive, and they fished the waterways and their kids drank from the wells.

Pandemic 2: Bird Flu Boogaloo,2022-04-29 09:57:42,colorado
"You may be drawing a conclusion that isn’t exactly there. I am not sure if you are insinuating that farm bird are dying from the bird flu in such numbers because they are weak farm birds. 

I mean healthy chickens give good eggs, and I’m all for that.

That said, the current bird flu appears to be moving through wild birds pretty quickly, which are pretty organic all things considered. 


Various state agencies are requiring mass slaughter of large amounts of chickens (millions) to try and slow or stop the outbreak from reaching wild birds so that it stops spreading. I mean it already has but that is a side point. 

Anyways “we” keep slaughtering millions of chickens that aren’t necessarily infected or otherwise affected. If testing shows an infection in a area generally all are killed quickly. “We” are slaughtering millions of chickens to attempt to stem the spread to wild birds and other industrial farming places. Often under orders by the state. 

Now you might make the argument that bird flu is more likely to start and gain significant foot hold due to factory farming. However it appears that once it gets out to wild birds, it’s still going to kill large amounts of them. So I’ll ask, which  robustness are you talking about?

"You seem to be putting words in my mouth. 

I have no problem with the industry not knowing about prions in advance. That's understandable: feeding cows mammalian proteins didn't have a harm that we knew of in advance, I had no objection to them doing that. Once it became clear though that mad cow was a possibility, the industry had a right to argue ""nah, lets ignore it, I'm sure its fine, cheaper hamburgers!"" but obviously the rest of society should have and did say ""absolutely not, you need to take steps to prevent mad cow tainting the food supply even if it costs more.""

Using bedding from chickens (I gather that's what's going on here) we evidently know to be a liability for spreading bird flu and it needs to stop. I don't blame the industry for using it initially if they didn't know it could cause human deaths to make slightly more profit, that's to be expected from any industry, but now we need to force them to stop doing it and we're fools if we don't pass laws stopping it.

I also have no complaint about inefficiencies leading to higher costs. I know I'm in the minority here but I do NOT think that it should be ""as cheap as possible"" if that ignores externalized costs like breaking antibiotics, spreading disease, and making the climate permanently unstable.

Saving five dollars off hamburgers at those ignored costs is not worth it to me. I'd much rather the meat industry do it safely (for the rest of the world) or not at all.

Again, that's on us, not the industry, to regulate it. We as a society are idiots if we don't pass laws banning antibiotics, the use of any and all technology to limit GHG (from livestock industries and all other industries) and implement a carbon tax as appropriate to be able to counter the effects of GHG externalized costs.

The meat and dairy industries won't do it on their own, except token gestures to get us to forget about it and think the problem is solved so they can keep maximizing profit.

It's not necessarily the best approach, IMO. Something that could be revised and would probably help decrease the incentive not to report that kind of thing.

If we just let a virus mutate among thousands of feral horses in BLM pens, there’s a real possibility we’ll have the “equine flu” pandemic too. 

It’s irresponsible to just let these horses stay where they are. They need to be adopted out, and the rest need to be euthanized. Maybe we should allow hunters to take out feral horses in the same way they’re allowed to take out Eurasian Collard Doves and European Starlings.

"From the article:

&gt;In Colorado, there has been one case of an individual contracting avian flu from an infected bird. The case occurred in Delta County this April, when an individual came in direct contact with diseased poultry by doing culling at a commercial farm. The individual did not experience any severe symptoms, and there was no other transmission following this.

I would also note that a Google News search shows other articles about this subject and it looks like the issue is with birds. It's a disaster for agriculture due to how contagious and potentially fatal this is for birds.

However, it  does not appear to be a major issue with humans at this time--certainly not the next COVID-19, if that's what anyone has in mind.",2022-10-09 09:35:55,colorado

"Fuck paywalls

&gt;Raccoon kills eaglet in Front Range bald eagle nest that’s livestreamed via webcam
Eaglet that perished at Xcel Fort St. Vrain nest was six weeks old. A sibling eaglet survived, as did the parents.

&gt;A six-week-old eaglet was attacked by a raccoon and killed at Xcel Energy’s Fort St. Vrain facility near Platteville on Monday, Colorado Parks and Wildlife has confirmed.
The bald eagle family has a large following because two “eagle cams” are focused on the nest around the clock. Many follow the eagles via the Fort St. Vrain Eagle Cam Facebook group.
A second eaglet survived the attack, as did the mother and father. CPW said wildlife officer Mike Grooms responded to investigate 90 minutes after the attack.
“The camera showed a raccoon scaling to the top of the nest tree and grabbing the older, larger of the two eaglets from the nest around 7 p.m.,” the CPW statement said. “Wildlife officer Grooms was able to collect what remained from the carcass and delivered it to CPW’s Wildlife Health Lab, where officials will submit it for testing of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.”
CPW noted that the nest dates back to 1993 and the camera went online in 2003.
“What followers saw on Monday was a natural event,” the statement said. “Predation of eaglets is not something you often hear about. Without a webcam, such events are hard to document. The vast majority of nest failures in Colorado are attributed to weather events (such as windstorms that damage or destroy nests or nest trees), new nests/inexperienced pairs, the loss of an adult during the nesting season and potentially human-related disturbance in the immediate area.
“The most likely mammalian predator of bald eagles in Colorado’s Front Range are raccoons, while avian predators include magpies, crows and ravens, hawks and owls.”
Many fans of the Fort St. Vrain eagles have commented on the Facebook group page, expressing their sadness over the incident. The group has more than 4,000 members.",2022-06-01 15:49:54,colorado

"This is something that I've been keeping close tabs on because we raise our own ducks and geese.

This particular strain has been going through bird flocks from Asia to Europe and now to the US and North America like wildfire. Waterfowl apparently don't show any symptoms, just mysteriously die. Dryland birds like chickens and turkeys show symptoms but die quickly, and the entire flock gets very sick very fast and often dies off within days. It is only jumped to a couple of people, and they were ones who worked closely with sick animals in not so clean conditions. The odds of this bird flu jumping to humans at this point, I think, is pretty low given that it has been spreading around the world with migrating birds and affected many small flocks and commercial flocks as well. A whole lot of humans have been exposed with no sickness. It also does not seem to be jumping to other mammals.

The infected flock in Michigan is a homestead flock not far from me, and there are a lot of us in Southwest Michigan who have small flocks. We are keeping our birds inside their duck yard when we have been allowing them to free-range. They are recommending that people keep their birds either inside a coop that cannot be infiltrated by wild birds or do what they can to keep food and water away from wild birds and follow serious biohazard protocols.

"That could be a new strain of COVID, sometimes new strains do not show as positive on the new tests.

There's also a risk that this could be the feared Human to Human contagious H5N1 Bird Flu, within the last week, it another farm worker in Michigan was found to have it, but this time, with the virus in the lungs. Being in the lungs is the.... big deal issue with H5N1. 

Anyway, maybe get your doctor to have your test sent to the CDC.

If you aren't dead yet... you'll likely still survive.",2024-06-01 09:45:22,michigan

* respiratory issue was related to milk droplets entering lungs for a worker
* milk did get in one man's eye which expressed itself as conjunctivitis but never respiratory
* the virus \*is\* present in meat but everyone's a little freaked out because it's uncharted territory so cook your meat

"That makes me even more angry. It proves they had no reason to jack up the price of eggs yet they still did and made a 700% increase in revenue.

At least the avian flu excuse made sense. We have less chickens so they give out less eggs. Supply goes down, demand did not, so price goes up. This situation is supply stayed the same, demand stayed the same, so price goes up because of corporate greed.",2023-04-07 14:35:42,michigan

"HPAI (along with H5 and H7 strains of low pathogenic avian flu, and Newcastle which can be clinically indistinguishable from HPAI) has been a reportable disease in poultry for ages.. it's not like influenza surveillance is new. It's considered a matter of national defense since it could have an utterly devastating economic impact on our poultry industry. 

And they're watching crossover events with good reason; the 1918 H1N1 ""Spanish flu"" pandemic likely got some of its genes from an HPAI strain, and the 1968 H3N2 outbreak was an avian strain that crossed into humans. There's good reason to be watching infections in cats and dogs, since they have much more exposure to humans and could serve as a ""mixing vessel"" for a better human-adapted strain.",2024-05-26 18:04:40,michigan

"As a public health nurse, this is a pretty good answer. Call you local health department. Speak with communicable disease and they will guide you. (Commenter is right, probably won't hear back until Monday, I'm sorry.)

Here's some info on this (linked below) although things are rapidly changing right now with Highly Pathogenic Avian Flu. Branch county is not currently identified as a michigan county with HPAI so this finding is of a bit of significance. 

Don't handle them with your bare hands. If possible keep them away from other animals especially cats as they are having quite poor prognosis.

 i'm retired after working more years than you've been alive so you can set all that aside and instead of assuming the worst about everyone in the world except yourself (which apparently you need to do to feel better about your sad self,) you can use the internet to learn a little about supply and demand, and things like bird flu.

"&gt;Eggs? One of the food items that have increased in price the most in the past year?  
&gt;  
&gt;Processed food does tend to be cheaper, even if they need to use Whole Foods as their main ingredients. Process foods are able to use Whole Foods that tend to be cheaper. Ever heard of corn syrup? Why do you think corn is a main ingredient in the vast majority of processed foods.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, I find it incredibly ironic that you criticized my point of view for being to simplified, yet the second I bring up economic concepts that are just outside of Econ 101 you disengage and call it a “word salad”. Pick a side man

ok, ok.  so i just smoked a bowl which tends to increase my tolerance for all kinds of pain, including the psychic pain incurred by reading this and the sadness i feel for you to believe all that makes sense.

eggs went up because of shortages due to bird flu, not demand due to poor people getting snap benefits. they're still a great source of protein and dirt cheap compared to say steaks, so your point is meaningless and one i figured you'd latch on to because it's *so fucking simple* and requires no thought past surface ones.

aside from the capitals on 'whole foods' which i'll assume your phone did for you, you're fucking nuts!  why do you think corn syrup is cheap again?  did it occur to you that the starting material must be even *cheaper*?  so much so you can process the shit out of it and still make money.

how about we just mill it into taco shells and give them away.  giving them away will cost more than the fucking taco shells.  labor is much more of a cost in any foodstuff than the actual food, that cost is included in your retail cost.

yes, *your* grasp of economics is certainly just a shade past econ 101, and it shows.

lets start with the bias you show when you categorize food assistance as ""free money"", shall we?  what IS free money to you?

does someone who inherited a house they never lifted a finger to earn receive 'free money'?  how about if they sell the house, buy bonds with that money and get interest every year without lifting another finger?  is THAT free money? 

or, even if they earned it working, and live off the interest, is that free money?

 how about banks that use your deposits to buy bonds and capture that interest?  that free money?  or if they lend against said bonds to capture MORE interest from someone buying a house?  they didn't create that money, or produce goods, not at all, nowhere along the chain, so, is that free money?

i think farmers are just fine with food subsidies, or they should be.  they're still getting paid no matter who consumes it and it benefits all of society when everyone is fed.

creating false dichotomies with 'poisons' isn't thinking through the problem, it's avoiding thinking.",2023-01-11 16:44:39,ohio

animals exposed to the smoke and any vapors i'm sure are impacted, that's not a surprise to anyone, why would it be a surprise to you?  they ordered evacuation immediately after the crash and expanded it for the burn-off.  anyone with a brain took heed and moved their animals as well.  i think it would be a stretch to think they weren't offered any assistance to do so.  where were all these great country neighbors i hear about all the time?

the most i've seen reported is a fox (which is an exotic pet and shouldn't be one imo) and some chickens.  damn near anything kills chickens, so that's not a surprise. it could have been bird flu even.

there ARE legitimate concerns about water and continued volatile compounds at the site, but frankly, you stand next to a diesel truck for a few minutes and you're getting just as much crap in you.

But look at the reports of people in the area - chickens literally dead overnight, foxes falling ill, countless fish floating down the river dead, and civillians reporting a chemical taste in the air. The plume looks post apocalyptic and it irritates when people say its just bird flu. Just lets the corporations responsible for this hide away while people debate why animals are dying whether things are safe etc. They want people to argue and there to be confusion because then they can hide behind it.",2023-02-13 15:21:49,ohio
That could be either from the derailment or bird flu... Should probably have them tested.,2023-02-14 06:27:35,ohio
"Here's my thoughts to politely disagree with you and why

Put all the covid stuff aside for a minute - think for a moment about the very high chance we have of another pandemic with a completely different disease.  Right now bird flu has been infecting birds and mammals globally and spreading rapidly. very rarely it has infected humans and has not yet transferred human to human. But when it has infected humans, it's roughly a 50% survival rate. About half the people infected so far have died.  It is a matter of time before this virus mutates so that it can be transferred more easily to humans and between humans.  Seriously - this is not an if but when. 

And when that happens think about all the people who refused to wear masks in public during covid who got violent and acted out and thought covid was fake - now we have those same people who are going to hop on the conspiracy train again ever more than last time because there's ANOTHER pandemic.  Except now instead of a 1% death rate like with covid it's almost 50%.  

 There will still be people who have to go out in public to keep society running. Can you imagine if that was you, or someone you love knowing that if they got infected it would be a coin flip if you or they survived?  

I would want our government to use every tool we had to help protect everyone I cared about, so that the people who had no choice but to use public transport and public spaces would be a little more protected and maybe not have to get sick and suffer and die because some selfish assholes who were lucky enough to not get killed by the disease value their personal liberty so much they will kill half the other people they spread the disease to.  

I don't think we will have mask mandates again for covid. I think politicians talking about them now is because we have another variant and it becomes a talking point and a way to rally their base and garner support and make people mad about a problem that doesn't exist anymore. 

 But to make this impossible to do in the future when we could have a much more deadly disease where we want every tool available to curb the spread and keep our society and economy functioning is short sighted.",2023-09-06 14:22:46,ohio

Same thing for the cost of groceries. For example the recent price hike in eggs. That had to with a bird flu that wiped out millions of chickens in America. Chickens make eggs.

"Cal-Maine Foods

FTA:

“The largest egg producer in the United States said Tuesday that it temporarily ceased operations at one of its Texas facilities after detecting bird flu in chickens — the latest in a steady uptick of cases among U.S. farm animals in recent weeks.

Cal-Maine Foods said it culled about 1.6 million hens and 337,000 pullets (young hens) after some of its chickens at a Parmer County, Texas, facility tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by influenza A viruses that spread widely among wild and domestic birds.

A dairy worker in Texas was being treated for the virus that causes avian influenza, becoming only the second known human case in the United States, state and federal officials said Monday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the person tested positive for H5N1 bird flu.

The culled chickens at Cal-Maine Foods represent 3.6 percent of its flock as of March 2, it said. The company said “no farm is immune from HPAI” but added that it “remains dedicated to robust biosecurity programs across its locations.”

Minnesota officials reported the first infection of bird flu among livestock in the United States last month, when a juvenile goat living on a farm with infected chickens tested positive.

Last month, bird flu was also detected in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas. Later that week, U.S. officials said that cows in Michigan had tested positive and that there were presumptive positive tests among cows in Idaho and New Mexico, suggesting that the virus may be spreading among cattle.

On Tuesday, Michigan’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced that bird flu was detected at a commercial poultry plant in Ionia County, “the fourth detection of HPAI in a commercial facility” since the virus was first spotted in the state in 2022.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture also said Tuesday that cases were detected in a dairy cow herd in Idaho.

Officials have said the risk to human health remains low. But the CDC has warned that people with unprotected exposure to infected birds or other animals, including livestock, are at greater risk of infection.

People should also avoid uncooked or undercooked food, unpasteurized milk and raw cheese, according to the CDC. Cooking eggs or poultry to an internal temperature of about 165 degrees Fahrenheit generally “kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses,” it says. Backyard chickens or pet chickens are at risk if they come in contact with wild birds carrying the virus.

Human symptoms of bird flu include eye redness, fever, coughing, sore throat, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or seizures are less common, the CDC said.”",2024-04-03 12:29:20,texas

"In early February, dairy farmers in the Texas Panhandle began to notice sick cattle. Nearly 60 days passed before veterinarians identified the culprit: a highly pathogenic strain of the bird flu virus, H5N1. Had it been detected sooner, the outbreak might have been swiftly contained. Now it has spread to at least eight other states, and it will be hard to eliminate. 

Why did it take so long to recognize the virus on high-tech farms in the world’s richest country? Because even though H5N1 has circulated for nearly three decades, its arrival in dairy cattle was most unexpected. Tests for contagious diseases known to whip through herds came up negative. Some farmers wondered if the illness was related to ash from wildfires devastating land to the east.

An early indication that something had gone awry on farms in northwestern Texas came from devices hitched to collars on dairy cows. Darren Turley, executive director of the Texas Association of Dairymen, describes them as “an advanced fitness tracker.” They collect a stream of data, such as a cow’s temperature, its milk quality, and the progress of its digestion — or, rather, rumination — within its four-chambered stomach. What farmers saw when they downloaded the data in February stopped them in their tracks. One moment a cow seemed perfectly fine, and then four hours later, rumination had halted. “Shortly after the stomach stops, you’d see a huge falloff in milk,” Turley said. “That is not normal.”

In hindsight, Turley wished he had made more of the migrating geese that congregate in the panhandle each winter and spring. Geese and other waterfowl have carried H5N1 around the globe. They withstand enormous loads of the virus without getting sick, passing it on to local species, like blackbirds, cowbirds, and grackles, that mix with migrating flocks. But with so many other issues facing dairy farmers, geese didn’t register. 

Sometime in March, viruses appear to have hitched a ride to other states as cows were moved between farms. The limited genomic data available links the outbreak in Texas directly to others in New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota. However, the routes are imprecise because the USDA hasn’t attached dates and locations to data it releases.

Researchers don’t want to be caught off guard again by the shape-shifting H5N1 virus, and that will require keeping tabs on humans. Most, if not all, of about 900 people diagnosed with H5N1 infections worldwide since 2003 acquired it from animals, rather than from humans, Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at the World Health Organization said. About half of those people died.

Occasional tests of sick farmworkers aren’t sufficient, he said. Ideally, a system is set up to encourage farmworkers, their communities, and health care workers to be tested whenever the virus hits farms nearby.",2024-05-23 16:20:29,texas

"Because of the near 100 % mortality in wild birds (largely passerines)  and commercial chicken and turkey flocks ,and potential virulency when it jumps to humans (aout 50% mortality) global monitoring of of H5N1  and its ""cousins"" has been a top priority since the late nineties.  H5N1 highly pathogenic avian flu is highly mutable and often described as ""the big one"" by virologists and epidemiologists. Covid is referred to as ""preparedness practice"" for a H5N1 human pandemic.  I feel relieved that many countries are alert, have been historically prepared or beginning to prepare. Many have stockpiled somewhat effective antivirals and prototype vaccines. The vaccine use ""old technology' and would require many months to ramp up production...that is a worry.  I hope we are working on new fast technology vaccines.  

  
What can we do? 

1.Pressure the FDA and related federal agencies  to ramp up monitoring and reporting of H5N1 in wild mammals (48 species to date have been affected), in commercial animal stock including dairy and beef cattle, and pigs and goats. Infections in pigs are especially concerning as we share similar genetic vulnerabilities"" to many pathogens.

3. Begin informing and educating the public, and listening to farmers. I have been impressed with local responses in the chicken and dairy industry. Farmers are very worried . They need the latest information as it emerges. But I worry that politics and money will carry more weight than public health. the FDA and associated federal agencies have their heads in the sand about this.  The public needs to be better informed and risks. 

4. Always be personally prepared for epidemics and pandemics. 

  
Where to go for information?  

1. I go to PubMed , where you can find all scientific papers and government documents from every country. But the papers are difficult going. Still if you want to try - do a search on avian flu in humans and limit it to the year 2023- 2024. I also go to the virology chat rooms. The science is pretty heavy but you can see the science reported without fear of government repercussions .. remember what happened to the chinese scientists and doctors who tried to warn about Covid in late 2019?

2. The WHO is more informative than the CDC.  

3. Media? Its tough to separate the fact from the fake.  As a biologist who teaches students to separate science fact from fake science the media source that is most scientifically/medically correct is the New York Times science section. ..not the editorials.  Many of the other media sources are loaded with disinformation.

4. Science News is an on line journal that takes the latest science and reviews it for the public. Its excellent.

5. I find it most useful to do a google search on : Avian Flu and set the date screen to most recent. Glance through the headings from scientific, academic and health sites to get a feel about the global and local impacts. Do look at new reports from our agricultural belts. See what our farmers and ranchers  are experiencing .

6. Avoid social media and conspiracy websites .. you want the cleanest, least politicized science and medicine  so you can make the most informed decision.

"I believe they worked on a dairy farm(I'm unsure of which one exactly) in the panhandle and contracted the virus there.

There have been several infected humans at this point, all from contact with infected cows and their bodily fluids, etc.

As of this moment, there is no recorded human to human transmission, and the virus would need to undergo the right mutations for that to happen.
But people can get sick from ingesting or improperly handling infected raw milk, raw cheese, or raw beef.

For what it's worth, the H5N1 virus is confirmed in a fairly large number of US dairy farms, not just in Texas. Something like ⅓ of all commercial milks in grocery stores are testing positive with the virus fragments, but pasteurization neutralizes it.",2024-05-05 20:00:03,texas
"You can check out the r/H5N1_AvianFlu subreddit which gets a lot of updates shared.

Some commenters are very level headed, some are bordering on prepping for a big outbreak, some are convinced the world will end and everyone will die.

As of right now, I don't think there's any significant risk of infection UNLESS you actively work in a dairy/cow farm, chicken/poultry farm, or interact regularly with animals that have been confirmed to be infected with the virus. Also, if you are actively avoiding handling and consuming raw OR undercooked beef, eggs, chicken, milk, cheese, etc, your risk is extremely low.

From my understanding, the virus has not reached human to human transmission. All confirmed human infections are from people who interacted with sick/infected animals/spaces.

The virus does need to go through certain mutations to be able to become human to human transmissible.

ONE of these mutations has been confirmed, but it needs to go through multiple mutations.

IF the virus is detected in pigs, these mutations become more likely and the risk becomes greater.

Other animals interacting with infected farm animals have fallen ill with quite severe symptoms and have died, including farm cats as well as a domestic NON farm cat, so the virus may be spreading to other cats outside of these farms.

Owners should keep their cats indoors, and also make sure their dogs don't try to lick/eat bird poop or raw/undercooked beef/eggs/dairy(if you feed your pet a raw/freeze dried diet, this is a legitimate concern).

The CDC has highly recommended farm workers wear appropriate PPE, but they essentially said the CDC can f•ck off and that they won't take extra necessary precautions.

But, as of right now, in this moment and stage of the virus, I wouldn't be too concerned if you're being careful about what you and your pets consume. Maybe also avoid spending time with any friends or family that actively work on at risk farms if you want to be extra extra extra cautious. This would be moreso due to if they have virus particles on their person from farm animal feces/fluids that you could pick up, not so much about any human to human transmission risk.

Additionally, the appropriate entities have stated that an adequate vaccine specifically for H5N1 could be created in a matter of weeks with an expedited rollout in the event that it does become human to human.

The greatest risk is in those early weeks/months before people can get vaccinated, so at the earliest confirmation of any human to human spread, just make some life changes and be extra careful(we all know how different people will handle this stage based on the Covid pandemic).",2024-05-12 15:13:32,texas

"It is raging through farms but we don't know what the human version will look like: infectivity rate and a whole host of other factors. COVID was quite unique in its infectivity rate and the nature of its asymptomatic spread. In retrospect, it was impossible to contain.

Other outbreaks have occurred where the infectivity rate is low and you can only transmit when symptoms are showing. The diseases are still difficult to contain, but we do a much better job. Swine Flu raged a couple years ago.. it was bad, but nowhere near as bad as COVID.

With H5N1, we have some vaccines, therapeutics and tests. As I understand it, the Flu A tests works on H5N1. I am not saying that scientists have a handle on it, but they know a lot about this flu already. As I understand it, there are very few human cases.

It could take days or years for it to transfer to humans in a form that is more transmissible. No one knows.

The real worry is that meat and food prices in general will spike because of this outbreak on farms. In the past two years, the multinationals have been cutting production capabilities. So, the next hiccup in the supply chain means higher prices.",2024-05-12 19:02:05,texas
"Are vaccinated against COVID-19 ? 

If not, you're fucked. I say you're fucked because any vaccine to H5N1 will be a mRNA vaccine and if you refused the COVID-19 vaccines it's highly probable you'll refuse this new vaccine. 

If you are current on your vaccinations, you'll most likely be fine because you'll follow common sense measures like social distancing, masking up in public and limiting your travel.",2024-05-12 21:40:11,texas
"I would probably be slightly concerned about feeding raw poultry or beef based foods to my pets since cats are confirmed to be vulnerable to the virus.

Commercial companies should be doing their own testing and due diligence to guarantee a safe and healthy product, but there definitely can be instances where something is missed or not properly cleared.

For instance, the local farm I buy my dairy from had an issue just recently when pasteurizing their chocolate milk and extended a recall and urged anyone who purchased the milk to return it for a full refund. Pasteurization neutralizes the virus.

It is a risk that the turkey in your pets food may be sourced from a farm that failed to properly cull/clear the virus from their flock before sending out bad meat and the pet food company may do their own testing but some bad batches may get out and be fed to pets before they catch it and issue a recall.

It's essentially a risk you have to decide if you want to take.

There are pet recalls on kibble based foods and canned foods. Sometimes, things just get through their protocols. I would personally consider raw pet foods to be a higher risk for now, though, just because of how widespread H5N1 seems to be across various farms and testing can't seem to keep up.",2024-05-12 22:40:29,texas

Eppisode summary: Richard Webby joins TWiV to review the history of avian H5N1 influenza virus, the recent change in epidemiological patterns, infection of dairy cattle in the US, and the risk of an outbreak in humans.

[Dr. Webby](https://www.stjude.org/directory/w/richard-webby.html) is a Flu researcher/expert at St Judes

Summary: Transmission of the current strain in cows is strange. It is not resperatory but seems to be passed from cow udder to udder in the milking area.  The strain does not have receptor binding domains for human or cow resperatory cells. The only documented cow to human case was conjunctividas because the human eye does have receptors for the strain. Cases in humans and other mammals are most likely under-tested and undercounted. 

The virus strain is deadly in ferrets. Ferrets are normally a good model for people disease, but not in this case.",2024-05-13 07:26:59,texas

**where have we seen human infections?:  Here's a clip from the very conservative CDC:**

More than 700 human infections with Asian HPAI H5N1 viruses have been reported to WHO from primarily 15 countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe and the Near East since November 2003. Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt have reported the highest number of human HPAI Asian H5N1 cases to date.

The first report of a human infection with Asian H5N1 in the Americas was in [Canada on January 8, 2014](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/news/first-human-h5n1-americas.htm) and occurred in a traveler recently returning from China. Although human infections with this virus are rare, **approximately 60% of the cases have died.**

The majority of human infections with Asian HPAI H5N1 have occurred among children and adults younger than 40 years old. Mortality has been highest in people aged 10-19 years old and in young adults. 

Most human Asian HPAI H5N1 cases have presented for medical care late in their illness and have been hospitalized with severe respiratory disease. However, some clinically mild cases have been reported, especially in children.",2024-05-13 12:25:31,texas

A wealthy person does cannot understand what it means to be poor, they cannot appreciate what food insecurity means. Wealthy people like Puppet Patty are so disconnected that they will say things like, ""Inflation is down, wagers are up and jobs are booming."" That is your Senator if you live in WA. She is completely disconnected because she is wealthy, everything is roses. In reality, housing in our state is so outrageous that a full third of the state is living in a home they cannot afford. They have housing insecurity because such a large portion of their income must be paid to cover housing that they cannot build savings, leaving them on the brink of financial disaster. That number jumps up to 40% of families with one child under the age of 6. Just to be clear, in this state, right now, 40% of households with a child under 6 years of age are living with housing insecurity. Why? Because she subsidizes major employers to keep wages low. People might be employed but they are underemployed, earning less than is necessary to afford this housing market.

Ultimately if H5N1 becomes a big thing Biden and Dems are probably toast anyway - the economic impact of another significant disease emergency just before the election would overrule any actual analysis of who did better handling COVID. Hogan might even have a shot in that case.",2024-05-16 09:55:14,maryland
Gosh that rainforest exhibit was my life. I was heartbroken when somebody stole the parrots from there because they closed that place for FOREVER. Same when bird flu popped up.,2023-04-14 18:01:08,kansas
"“It’s believed to be the first time bird flu – also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza – has been found in US livestock. But the commercial milk supply is safe, and risk to people is low, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).”",2024-03-26 11:50:20,kansas
I doubt SCZ will let you pet them right now. As far as I know the capybaras there are in the rainforest exhibit and that’s closed due to avian flu,2022-04-17 23:16:32,kansas
"The last city I worked in prohibited poultry as pets because of avian flu risk, since one of the big employers there was a turkey processing plant.",2023-02-01 18:29:22,kansas
I’m not worried about the avian flu I’m worried about the TURTLE FLU,2024-06-01 12:36:57,kansas
I'm all for getting vaxxed! And I don't drink raw milk. Worried about the quail I'm raising though....I'll have to read about the avian flu.,2024-06-01 16:38:06,kansas
H5N1 is loooooving this.,2024-05-16 15:07:42,kansas
"While this is concerning this is not going to be Covid again, we have vaccines that have been tested and even tested in children ready to go right now. We have vaccines stockpiled and there came a request from the Federal government to have millions more made, they are also funding the development of mRNA Moderna just finished phase 2 trials and are moving to phase 3. We have antivrials for it already.

The CDC is meeting this month to go over the strains for this years flu vaccine and to talk H5N1. 

If you work with animals especially if ones known to be infected wear PPE and don't consume raw milk. 

If this spreads any further go get the vaccine that we have already tested, I am sure there will be a mix of traditional vaccines and mRNA ones as if this became a pandemic, we seem to be in a good position to kick this things ass if it ends up going anywhere. Which is an if at this point.",2024-06-01 12:31:11,kansas
