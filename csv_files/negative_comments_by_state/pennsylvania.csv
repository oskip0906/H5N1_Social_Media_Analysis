"That price gouging ripples down the supply chain, though.    

&amp;nbsp;  

Example:  
During the avian flu stuff Cal-Maine, a company that has cornered a huge segment of the egg market in the US, raised prices immensely to price gouge *despite not really being affected by the avian flu*.   This resulted in a 700%+ increase in profits for Cal-Maine.

&amp;nbsp;  
This price gouging up the supply chain directly impacted the bottom line for breakfast restaurants at the bottom of the chain, who were forced to cut into or negate their entire profit margin so that companies like Cal-Maine could post record profits.

There is so much misinformation, denial, and apathy in these comments alone regarding covid, masks, and vaccines in general, and we wonder why people are sicker longer and more often, why people are flakier, angrier, more impulsive. Our own gov and health authorities are letting us down, public health has become individualized and politicized.

"I don't see how my comment lacked nuance, but let me try again...

The real problem is that COVID is not a *major* virus, but it's also not a *minor* virus. A *major* viral pandemic would be something like H5N1 (the one most of us in the research community have been worried about for the last decade-and-a-half). The case fatality rate of H5N1 is close to 60%...so we wouldn't be talking about millions of dead, but more like *billions* of dead.

At the same time, COVID's case fatality rate is still greater than *literally any other currently circulating disease*. It's greater than HIV (with modern treatments). Without vaccination it's greater than malaria. Even *with* vaccination it's in the same ballpark as malaria, and malaria has a much more limited range. 2 years into the pandemic, and the statistics just recently released show that for those age 45-54, COVID was the leading cause of death in the US...more than cancer, more than heart disease, more than car accidents.

So, calling COVID ""minor"" depends heavily on how you define that term. If I asked you if a 1% case fatality rate was ""minor"", maybe you'd say yes. In that case, COVID, at a case fatality rate of somewhere between 0.1% and 0.05% would qualify as ""minor"".

But would you call the communicable disease with the highest case fatality rate of any disease currently circulating in the human population ""minor""?

...I guess it's all relative.",2022-07-16 01:25:49,philadelphia,Sadness,0.9593511819839478
"Did you read the article you posted?
