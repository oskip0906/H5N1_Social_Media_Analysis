"Totally. I'm sure the daycare is paying more for diapers, toilet paper, electricity, natural gas, and everything else they use. No different from all of us at home. Sadly, they have to pass those costs along.

I suppose their other option is cutting back on some of those things but my guess is most parents wouldn't like that. 

From June 2021 to June 2022, natural gas prices increased 165.5% across the US. ""We don't want to raise your daycare rates, but to save costs we're turning the thermostat down this winter and encourage you to dress your kids warm. We'll no longer be serving hot food.""

Most all of our own workplaces are doing the same. Businesses generally try to absorb some of it (I know my own company has) but at some point you do have to pass along at least some of that to the customers. I don't know of anyone who has had their boss come to them and say, ""We're paying more for all the resources we use, but we don't wanna pass that to the customer so we need to cut your pay by 10% in order to keep from having to impact customers.""

Much of it is likely because we don't always understand the reason behind the increases. When they're explained, most are accepting of it. I know with my own customers, they've been very understanding in that we've laid out how we've shouldered some of the cost increases to our own business but have had to pass along some of it (less than our competitors have passed along).

"From CNBC article: 

""It may seem counterintuitive that egg and chicken prices moved in opposite directions.
The dynamic is primarily due to a severe outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. — which has killed many egg-laying hens but has largely left chickens raised for meat production unscathed, according to economists.

Chickens raised for meat consumption — known as ""broilers"" — aren't affected by avian flu to the same extent as the ""layers.""
""It's two totally different styles of production, two totally different breeds of bird,"" Moscogiuri said.
The life cycle of a broiler is much shorter — anywhere from 5.5 to 9 weeks, from hatch to slaughter, according to Vencomatic Group, a poultry consulting firm.

However, the life cycle for an egg-laying hen can be upwards of 100 weeks, Moscogiuri said. It can take about five to six months for layers just to reach full productivity, according to the Agriculture Department.
The latter are therefore more susceptible to bird flu since farmers must keep them alive for a longer time, experts said.
Broiler quantity is also up, contributing to lower chicken prices at the grocery store.""",2023-04-04 06:10:33,minnesota,Sadness,0.869137167930603

"&gt;Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed in two poultry flocks in Minnesota, the state Board of Animal Health announced Saturday.

&gt;The agency said the affected poultry flocks are a commercial flock of nearly 300,000 turkeys in Meeker County, and a backyard flock of 17 chickens, ducks and geese in Mower County. Samples collected from both flocks were tested on March 25 and confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

&gt;The state Board of Animal Health said they're the first confirmed cases in Minnesota in 2022.

&gt;Back in 2015, 9 million birds in Minnesota were killed by the virus, or euthanized to slow its spread. The virus is believed to be spread by migrating waterfowl in the spring.

&gt;Poultry producers in the state had been on high alert for weeks, and taking steps to increase biosecurity, after the virus was detected in neighboring states, including Iowa and South Dakota.

&gt;Officials cautioned that the appearance of avian flu in a backyard flock is a key difference from the 2015 outbreak.

&gt;""We are prepared to make sure this outbreak stays small,” said Dr. Jill Nezworski, a poultry veterinarian and a board member of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. “And I want to remind all poultry owners that biosecurity takes 100 percent commitment, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.""

According to the United Egg web site you provided, there is no mention of a 20% decrease in egg laying production from 2021 to 2022.

As I understand it, the 59 million number applies to *all* chickens across the US, which is the 9 billion number. I can't find any source saying the *overall* US chicken population was decimated by 20% last year.

And to tie this back to the OP's original post about Kwik Trip chicken tender prices, aren't we talking about the price of broilers anyways?

I think this is another example of how statistics can be used to distort an industry agenda.

"1. We're not ignoring the 9 billion broiler number, that was your number, that we now know is irrelevant because the avian flu mostly affected egg layers.  
2. Even if the chickens that were culled/died were broilers - *you still have to immediately redirect 60 million eggs to the hatcheries to replace them.* That affects the prices of chickens and eggs.  60 million food chickens is equal to the American intake of 2 days worth.  That might not seem like much, but remove 2 days worth of oil from the market and see what that does to gas prices. 
3. The Time Magazine sources were *almost entirely from Farm Action and/or it's representatives, a biased anti-corporate action group who are making a claim based on their own analysis of one company's SEC filing.*   The only other sources in the article are the SEC filing itself, and one academic's quote that has nothing to do with the claim in the article. 
4. Farm Action's single argument seems to be that Cal Foods (and by extension the entire industry) was gouging because they earned too much money.
5. The question then becomes, how much is too much? Again this is basic math.  If an egg cost 5cents to make and ship, and I told it for 15cents, then I make ten cent profit.  If now my production cost is still 5 cents but the market is buying at 40 cents, I'm now making a 26 cents (or 500%) profit.  Is that too much?  Why would they be obligated to sell below market value?
6. It doesn't mean the entire industry made this level of profits, in fact they probably didn't.  Cal Foods wasn't affected by the flu, so the increase in the value of their product was a windfall. There were other companies that saw essentially their entire flock get culled and had to rebuild from zero. 
7. Honestly, Cub foods probably gouged more than they did, because Kwik Trip sold eggs for $3/doz while Cub sold for $5/doz.  I've always found Cub Foods to be the most predatory food retailer in the area.",2023-10-23 12:33:14,minnesota,Anger,0.9523325562477112

"Here’s the full post from the Raptor Center:

On April 12th and 13th, The Raptor Center responded to reports of three great horned owl nest mates in distress from a nest in Lake Nokomis Park in Minneapolis. On admission to our triage hospital building, all three were suffering from extreme neurological signs and one suddenly died. Due to a high level of suffering, the remaining two youngsters were humanely euthanized and all three tested for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). Today, not only did we receive notice that the young owl samples tested positive, but we also responded to calls about two deceased adult great horned owls in the same area, presumed to be the parents. We highly suspect that their samples will be positive too. 

We are heartbroken at The Raptor Center to see the presumed loss of an entire great horned owl family due to HPAI and unfortunately this is not the first one we have responded to during this outbreak. Nearly every day we are admitting patients that come in suffering from the severe symptoms of HPAI.

Minnesota is experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of HPAI in wild bird populations and unfortunately 90-100% of raptors who are infected will die from the disease. The Raptor Center is doing everything possible to continue to safely receive, triage, and treat birds in need during this difficult time and our team deeply appreciates all the help and the support from the community while we do so. 

If you find a raptor in need please call us at 612-624-4745 or visit our website at raptor.umn.edu
