"No. Not even close. Are you? I don't know if you're aware but they want to build the world's longest gondola up LCC and they want us to pay for it. Meanwhile, the Southwest is turning to dust, Russia wants to nuke the world, there's a flu going around that kills 1% of us and a bird flu that's going to cause us to not have chickens or eggs/eggs or chickens. Meanwhile, Cottonwood Heights is perhaps the most corrupt police force in the state, even more so than the SLC Airport PD and OP would kill for a stupid fucking chicken noodle recipe.

My sailboat has been sitting on stands in the GSL marina parking lot for 3 of the past 5 years. My kids can't afford to buy a home within 75 miles of me without a post-graduate degree and Bangerter eastbound through Riverton in the morning looks like a mass evacuation. Lake Bowel is going to stop producing electricity soon and St. George wants the rest of us to pay $3 BILLION for a pipeline to water their golf courses. Never mind the $3 BILLION they want us to pay to dam the Bear River.

"When we went to Antelope Island and saw hundreds of dead birds, we were told there have been mass die-offs in the past due to bird flu and other causes, and the reason there are so many bodies is the salt water preserves them. So some of the corpses can be years old and they just keep stacking up. 

It’s horrific and with the lake drying up is going to get so much worse.

I agree with u/tacocatistacocat about calling the Utah DWR though. It can’t hurt to make sure they’re aware of how bad the problem is.",2023-02-05 13:14:39,saltlakecity,Sadness,0.6182758808135986

It could be bird flu but also birds don’t seem to decompose in that salty stuff they way they would elsewhere. There are often mass death events that leave carcasses for years. It wouldn’t hurt to notify Utah DWR to make sure they know.

"The price of something is determined by supply vs demand. If there is a low supply and a high demand for a specific commodity (i.e. housing), the price will be high. In order to bring the price down, there either needs to be an increase in supply or a decrease in demand.

Building more houses increases the overall supply, thus lowering the price.

Another example is eggs. The price of eggs has increased dramatically recently because of an egg shortage due to a bird flu (avian influenza) outbreak that occurred over a year ago. The outbreak caused a drop in the number of chickens which then lead to a decrease in egg yield later on. The demand for eggs didn't change, but the supply went down. This caused the price of eggs to skyrocket. The only way to decrease the price of eggs (without government intervention) is to increase the supply of eggs. Until the supply of eggs increases enough to match the demand, expect high egg prices.

Similarly, until the supply of housing in SLC increases to match the demand, expect high housing prices.",2023-02-10 13:22:55,saltlakecity,Anger,0.9636539816856384

Not likely. Migrating birds usually stop at GSL to eat loads of brine shrimp and brine fly larvae on their migrations. It isn’t quite migration season (unless you are a large raptor).

"Okay two thoughts. 

1) how can these apartments be luxury, but also faux luxury? Luxury is just a branding term. None of the ""luxury"" apartments are anything special. It's all just new housing that they want to pretend is flashy. 

2) that's exactly my point. We've chronically underbuilt housing, (and pretty reliably only allowed single family home) for at least since the financial crisis in 08 and probably before. We're so short on housing that vacancy rates are at an all time low, even at high prices! It seems obvious to me that replacing a few single family homes with 100 apartments is a clear win because we need the housing! Look at places that have wealthy residents and have fought up zoning effectively (aves, east bench, most of the suburbs). You got shitty 100 year old tiny houses selling for over a million because people want to live there! 

Remember when egg prices jacked up last year like crazy? It was because millions of chickens had to be killed because of an avian flu, restricting supply of eggs. Prices went up. Fortunately now, the hatching chicken population has recovered, and supply rose to meet demand. It's just a lot hard to build more homes than hatch more chickens.",2023-09-12 22:59:45,saltlakecity,Sadness,0.7603403925895691

1. Great big checks from the government had a lot to do with this, but no one ever accuses the government if screwing them with their handouts.
2. When you have millions of chickens culled because of avian flu, the price of eggs goes up.  When you have diesel and gas at record levels, the price of transportation and agriculture goes up.

"I took this photo while showing some European friends around Zion in 2010.

I recently met a condor biologist studying the birds near Cedar Breaks and we discussed condor recovery, their role in the ecosystem, and mortality rates.

Lead poisoning is the number one cause of Condor (and birds of prey overall) mortality.

Condors are carrion feeders, they scavenge gut piles left behind by hunters, which leads to lead poisoning very quickly, one tainted gut pile can spell death for these birds. This year, Condors are being killed by rampant avian flu in Arizona and Southern Utah, adding more stress to their already tenuous population recovery.
