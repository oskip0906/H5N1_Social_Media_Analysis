Bird flu is ravaging the industry.",2022-02-19 21:48:11,Columbus,Sadness,0.9980270266532898
"Hot chicken has been not fairing well compared to other Columbus restaurants I’ve been to since the onset of the pandemic, other than the ones that have closed down, obviously. 

I know the bird flu has been a serious problem for them, though the couple times I went, the chicken was one of the only things that have stayed consistent in quality. Both times all their sides were noticeably worse. I don’t think their Mac is homemade anymore (or at least its more apparent it’s made elsewhere) and the beans were really stale too. Have they been this way before the pandemic and I just now notice? Or is this a recent development? I don’t think they’re changing the tea as often or putting lids on the top of their canisters, one time my friend found a fruit fly in his tea. Overall it seems things have gotten more lax there.

I don’t know if they were just having an off-day both times, or if only the Easton Location is bad, but I just figured the supply chain problems have been making them cut a lot of corners. Even compared to other restaurants around though, hot chicken seems to have been struggling pretty bad. It’s a shame, really…",2022-02-25 20:33:26,Columbus,Anger,0.9911352396011353

"This is nonsensical. 

So let me get this straight – you want the government to take more of people's money as a threat for them to not sell their business? 

And your reason being is because you think that you know X market better than somebody else? 

&gt;Instead of taking a big payout, it's better to keep the company healthy and paying you for decades to come.

There's no guarantee that it'll pay for decades to come. Maybe the market gets saturated with fried chicken joints. Maybe fried chicken stops being trendy/desirable. Maybe there's a ""health"" push and people stop buying your product. Maybe a strain of bird flu wipes out every chicken farm in the country and suddenly you don't have a product.  

Why on earth are you against people cashing out when the moment is right? Just because a brand is worth a bunch of money now does not mean that it will be worth a bunch of money in two years.",2023-04-24 09:31:42,Columbus,Anger,0.9044303894042968

"Keep in mind a major part of the price increase is due to increased wage costs.

Next is that the US chicken supply was gutted, well terminated, because a few thousand birds were infected with bird flu.  Even though they were mostly isolated in a small local farm, the FDA mandated hundreds of millions be terminated WITHOUT testing to confirm infection.  Along with destruction of hundreds of millions of eggs per year since.  Again, without testing to confirm infection.

"Chicken (and egg) prices are up like 40%, partially due to general inflation, but also because of avian flu outbreak, which has been particularly bad this year. The guidelines for farmers for when a single bird contracts avian flu is to cull the entire flock. Now the supply of chicken is constrained and the price shoots up.

However, I will say that if Chipotle/other restaurants raise their prices to account for the higher chicken prices AND raises the price of their other protein options by the same amount as chicken; that is price gouging and using consumer psychology to maintain that beef/pork are luxury proteins and chicken isn't. Based on my last trip to Kroger, chicken is basically the same price as beef (ground and cheaper cuts excluding nice steak cuts), so why is there a 20% disparity between chicken and beef on most menus?",2022-12-19 10:15:09,Columbus,Anger,0.8419899940490723

In less than a month, all three had it, and you could literally watch it progress on a daily basis.  By mid-September only two birds were showing up, and one wasn’t looking good at all.  Talked with an avian biologist with DNR, and he said it’s pretty bad.

"I think the avian flu that went around last year or whenever impacted the food chain. Less birds of prey means more rabbits and squirrels. More of those means more food for coyotes.

I am afraid to be near birds with that ongoing.

That said (and with a sarcastic streak to boot), I have witnessed first hand (but not by my hands) how regularly feeding geese completely upsets the migratory habits of Canadia Geese.  They are supposed to migrate and eat plant matter near or in water, feeding them regularly causes them to settle at one pond year round.",2024-04-30 11:30:41,Columbus,Fear,0.999036192893982

"Here's my thoughts to politely disagree with you and why

Put all the covid stuff aside for a minute - think for a moment about the very high chance we have of another pandemic with a completely different disease.  Right now bird flu has been infecting birds and mammals globally and spreading rapidly. very rarely it has infected humans and has not yet transferred human to human. But when it has infected humans, it's roughly a 50% survival rate. About half the people infected so far have died.  It is a matter of time before this virus mutates so that it can be transferred more easily to humans and between humans.  Seriously - this is not an if but when. 

And when that happens think about all the people who refused to wear masks in public during covid who got violent and acted out and thought covid was fake - now we have those same people who are going to hop on the conspiracy train again ever more than last time because there's ANOTHER pandemic.  Except now instead of a 1% death rate like with covid it's almost 50%.  

 There will still be people who have to go out in public to keep society running. Can you imagine if that was you, or someone you love knowing that if they got infected it would be a coin flip if you or they survived?  

I would want our government to use every tool we had to help protect everyone I cared about, so that the people who had no choice but to use public transport and public spaces would be a little more protected and maybe not have to get sick and suffer and die because some selfish assholes who were lucky enough to not get killed by the disease value their personal liberty so much they will kill half the other people they spread the disease to.  

I don't think we will have mask mandates again for covid. I think politicians talking about them now is because we have another variant and it becomes a talking point and a way to rally their base and garner support and make people mad about a problem that doesn't exist anymore. 

 But to make this impossible to do in the future when we could have a much more deadly disease where we want every tool available to curb the spread and keep our society and economy functioning is short sighted.",2023-09-06 14:22:46,Ohio,Sadness,0.727713406085968

before anyone asks: no the industry isn't just butchering the female egg-layers for those $2/lb chicken breasts.   the chicken breed used for male/meat chickens is different than the one used for egg-laying and is less susceptible to bird flu.

I would expect the ""egg"" industry to expand breeds a little bit, and maybe reduce scale of operations by spreading out, to avoid massive losses. But since egg is a staple of breakfasts and recipes I suspect the industry is [largely still making profits](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/egg-producer-cal-maine-swings-to-q2-profit-amid-rising-prices-2022-07-19) even during this difficult year.",2023-01-09 07:46:41,Cleveland,Sadness,0.9073790907859802

"Eggs increasing make sense outside of inflation though. There was another round of avian flu that was breaking out so there were a lot of hens that were culled to prevent it from becoming a serious issue. Fewer chickens means fewer eggs and the price goes up. This happened a few years ago. The price did end up dropping after a while, not back to the original amount but still lower than the price hike.

Butter is the thing that's killed me with the prices. It's gone up in general, but some places I'll be shopping and see how expensive it is so I'll buy it elsewhere. I've been shopping at Miles Market a lot lately for produce especially because the price and quality is well worth it (Strawberries were between $1-$1.50 per pint, broccolini was on sale 2 for $3, etc.) I was going to pick up a pound of butter while there and Land o Lakes was $7.50.

"Eggs have come down in price and are beginning to normalize at prices higher than before the avian flu led to millions of birds being culled, but far below the peak. Simple Truth Natural Cage Free Eggs are $4/doz.

Still, OP is way off base thinking that small, local egg producers selling their eggs at a farmers’ market are going to be anywhere near as low as the prices of industrially produced eggs in a grocery store. Even if they’re sold at cost, that cost also has to take into account transporting the eggs to the market and standing there all day to sell them. I don’t know about OP’s time, but my time is worth more than $10/hr. The economies of scale and having shelf space in a self-service venue like a grocery store are what make eggs affordable, so OP should just stick with store-bought eggs if they don’t want to pay the premium for direct-to-consumer eggs produced by local farmers.",2023-04-01 10:33:53,cincinnati,Anger,0.9715818762779236

"No offense to OP, but this post is a prime example of conspiracy thinking. I’m not calling you a conspiracy theorist, I don’t know you and I don’t know how serious you are about this idea. But I like breaking down this kind of thing…

“I found a dead bird in my yard. There are no apparent injuries, so the explanation isn’t obvious.”

There’s nothing wrong with this as an observation by itself, but the next step before adopting any explanation would be to come up with a testable hypothesis. “I don’t see another explanation” is not the same thing as “there is no other explanation.” It’s called an argument from ignorance fallacy: I don’t know any other explanation, so I’ve adopted this one. 

“There are harmful chemicals in the air due to the East Palestine incident. Last night it rained and now there’s a dead bird. Could it be related?”

Again, as a question, there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with asking this. But a suggested explanation shouldn’t be adopted without clear evidence. “It’s possible” is not the same thing as “it’s actual.” Plus, one would need to demonstrate that a specific explanation is even possible before offering it. Has it been demonstrated to be possible for chemicals to travel from East Palestine to Dayton through clouds and rain? If it’s not shown to be possible, it’s not a candidate explanation. 

And correlation is not causation. “My rooster crowed this morning and the sun came up. My rooster must have caused the sunrise!” Two things happening near each other doesn’t mean there’s a causal link. 

Further, we have a single dead bird being floated as a possible pattern. We haven’t established a pattern yet, but let’s say we did. Let’s say more dead birds are found… maybe 5, maybe 10, maybe 1000. Maybe every single bird in Ohio drops out of the sky and dies. We would still need evidence to demonstrate a link between the events in East Palestine and the death of the birds. Simply assuming or asserting a connection is not sufficient, it must be demonstrated. 

Maybe, as another commenter pointed out, it’s avian flu. Maybe there are toxic chemicals in the air from the train derailment AND there’s also something else killing birds. Both could be true. Conspiracy thinking tends to adopt a simple explanation quickly, without considering all options. (Simple meaning satisfying to the person; it doesn’t mean conspiracy theories can’t be complex or complicated. Look at the various features included in OP’s potential explanation)

Conspiracy thinkers also fixate on anomalies. They focus on specific details which stand out or don’t seem to fit, while sometimes ignoring or missing other data. There may be hundreds of living birds flying around OP’s house, but they’ve focused on the dead one. If this is done intentionally (pointing to specific examples that match the theory and ignoring examples that don’t), it’s called cherry-picking.",2023-02-15 11:16:10,Dayton,Sadness,0.602692723274231

Many of our birds have temporarily moved indoors or inside a protected habitat. This is as a precaution for our birds’ safety as cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected in Ohio. Currently, all of our birds remain healthy.

There is no apparent risk to humans at this time. For our birds here at zoo, the risk comes from native birds who land during spring migration.
